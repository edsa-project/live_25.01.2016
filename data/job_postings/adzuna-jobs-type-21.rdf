<ns1:description>Data Manager / Information Architect - Governance &amp; Strategy There is now an exciting opportunity for an Information Architect / Data Manager to join this outstanding company. This is a senior role within the organisation with opportunity for progression. The current thinking is that you will become part of the Senior Management Team and report directly into the CIO. You will be responsible for the future state of data architecture and for determining the information strategies for Data within Group IT systems. You will manage the global master data quality through policies and processes and the direct management of the Data Management Team. What we’re looking for and why? The current IT landscape is full of opportunity because albeit the company are happy with the way their SAP System, CRM System and Web Content systems work, they are not interconnected. The various sites around the world are operating in a ‘silo’ mentality and in order to drive continued growth, Data has been put at the centre of this initiative. There has been board approval to bring this together now under the leadership and guidance of the new Information Architect/Data Manager. You will be tasked at looking at old systems that are ready for retirement, the management and maintenance of the ‘current’ systems as well as defining, setting and standardising the global enterprise policy and strategy for all future data systems and processes. To this end, we are searching for someone who understands data and how to connect the dots between the IT systems, in particular SAP, CRM and Web Services. The need to create an effective and coherent environment that provides world class digital marketing support is a top priority. Upcoming projects also include the transition in to a new CRM System as well as the potential introduction of SAP Hana to complement the core SAP and SAP BI Solution which also incorporates QlikView for Data Discovery and Dashboard reporting. The Web team are already delivering innovative solutions through the Microsoft SiteCore .Net platform. This really is an outstanding role with a great team who are continually pushing the business forward through technology enablement projects. Interoperability is key and we would like to speak to individuals that understand Data, Data Modelling, Policies and Processes above any particular technology stack. ‘YES’ excellent knowledge of SAP would be ideal as would Strong CRM exposure in products such as SAP, MS Dynamics or but we have SAP experts so this is not the key skill. If you have proven experience in ‘joining the dots’ and making disparate systems work together then we’d like to hear from you. What we are offering: Salary is up to ?65K Basic + Company related Bonus Scheme (up to 30%) + Outstanding Pension Scheme, Private Medical, Share option scheme, Free Parking, Free Lunches. If you have the skills, knowledge and experience then contact Scott Sherriden and Red Shrine (Leeds) to discuss this role in more detail. Closing date for the role is Friday 10th July because our goal is to fill the position by no later than Friday 24th July 2015.

<ns1:description>At Turning Point, we support people across the UK with substance misuse issues. As a Performance Manager, you&apos;ll have a big part to play in that as you make a real difference to the lives of people who are dealing with these issues. Add your management experience to our diverse organisation and you&apos;ll enjoy the chance to change your own future too. Based within Oxfordshire Roads to Recovery, you&apos;ll lead a small team in setting peak performance objectives across the service. Sharing your reports with commissioners, service managers and multi-disciplinary teams alike, you&apos;ll look at individual and group training needs before setting KPIs, SLAs and targets that you&apos;ll make sure are met. As you monitor outcomes, analyse data and anticipate future needs, you&apos;ll be creating an environment in which performance is truly valued at every level. You won&apos;t necessarily need experience of the substance misuse sector, but you&apos;ll certainly have shown that you can get the best out of teams by building and reporting on performance management frameworks, often on a large scale. The qualities you drew on to do this are numerous, and include an aptitude for leadership, the determination to get to the root of a problem, a flair for report writing and, of course, high level project management skills. As this Performance Manager role involves travel across the county to support all our Oxfordshire hubs, you&apos;ll need a full driving licence and vehicle too. Running health and social care services as a social enterprise, we invest every penny back into our care - and our people. So, if you&apos;re ambitious and inspired by the possibilities of the people we support, join a sector leader and work together for a better future for everyone. If you have any questions, or would like to discuss the Performance / Data Manager further please feel free to contact Andy Symons on andy.symons@turning-</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>We have an exciting and rare opportunity for an experienced Data Manager to join a very highly thought of Science based organisation located in Newmarket. This role will suit a Science graduate with a strong career history in Data management, a good working knowledge of databases and website development as this role is essentially to be responsible for all aspects of the company&apos;s data and its integrity.

The role will carry responsibility for two staff - one is a data inputter/cleanser/specialist, and the other is a PHP programmer creating the back end scripts for this function so an awareness of these areas is important in order to be able to manage them properly..... but there is no need to be able to actually do these roles to any great level or have these skills to any level past a general understanding (maybe it would have been covered in a course, or have been sitting with/in charge of staff carrying out these functions previously - the and the webdevelopment has been outsourced to a third party, therefore awareness of HTML, CSS would also be advantageous but again no need to have actually have this as a primary skill. The day to day activities will include a) managing the supplier data in conjunctino with the programmer and data specialist to ensure that the data is editied to a format that is acceptable for their product database b) providing date from the database that suits the requirements of the website, eprocurement platforms, tenders and other product listings c) sytematically meeting wtih existing and potential eprocurement platform providers to increase their depth and coverage of the clients products d) formulate and manage the data budget requirements annually e) monitor existing eprocurement platforms sales and review their effectiveness f) providing quarterly reports to the board on eprocurement and data g) managing other members of the data team to enable ta streamlined process h) managing the product database to ensre the data quality is optimised to provide the best outputs i) implementing best practice data procedures to ensure data integrity j) troubleshoot data errors k) ensure data for the website will provide customers with all that is requried for them to make an informed dcision with regards to purchase. This role will interact with suppliers, business development director, eprocurement officers, product managers, sales team, and customer services.

Areas of specialism are M&amp;A, Divestment, Application/Infrastructure rationalisation and integration. They are currently managing the M&amp;A integration of 2 international pharmaceutical businesses. Of great interest (but not essential) would be consultants with experience in Rail, Automotive, Infrastructure/Logistics industries (Rail/Road/Transportation/Shipping) In addition the consulting group are managing all outsourcing partners like CapGemini, Cognizant and Atkins at one of the UK&apos;s largest airports.

<ns1:description>Data Domain Analyst - CHS03106 Overview Maintaining a high-quality data resource which supports business goals through a documented and controlled chain of information and knowledge, is key to the success of any data-driven organisation. The Data Domain Analyst objective is to ensure that data is being provisioned and consumed from appropriate data sources and that the requisite processes and permissions are in place to govern data transmissions, both within and external to MBNA. This is fundamentally important in the context of data accuracy and (in particular) data security and confidentiality. Responsibilities The Data Domain Analyst will:- Provide critical guidance (and the associated decision-making recommendations) to internal and external stakeholders, up to senior management levels, as regards the data processes being assessed. Undertake impact assessments for all change management drivers (including Technology &quot;Permit-To-Build&quot; requests), as well as and making the associated approve/decline recommendations for data flows within and outside the company as regards &quot;Permit To Send&quot; obligations. Work closely with the Data Domain Manager, Data Provisioning/Quality Analyst and the Data Custodian to ensure Data Sharing Agreements (and the associated SLA’s) are in place across all relevant data domains. Guide the implementation of the MBNA Data Management framework to facilitate effective and sustainable data governance across the business throughout the phases of the data lifecycle and provisioning strategy. Serve as a central escalation point for data-related risks and issues associated with externally-hosted data (PTS) and internally hosted (EDM), to ensure a consistent approach across the enterprise. Maintain a documented portfolio of externally-hosted data and associated third-party relationships, including detailed technical and non-technical records for data elements. Design and compile data process flows, detailing the entry and exit points of data between MBNA and Third Party Data suppliers, identifying gaps and mapping relevant controls to data process flows. Provide guidance and support to enable business areas to achieve their goals and objectives in scope of Third Party Data Hosting Requirements, including education. Assist with the RFI / RFP process when selecting new vendors, as well as assisting all Lines of Business with remediation activities for their vendor hosted data. Ensure appropriate oversight is tracked with and reported to Data Domain Manager and Data Steward Executive, through sustainable governance routines and close working relationships. Design and deliver PTS and PTB processes and procedures, as well as checklists and education materials to increase awareness and adherence of EDM and PTS / PTB within MBNA. Required Significant experience of assessing, influencing and challenging high-profile and often complex business processes and data management practices. Experience of employing data management governance and compliance practices in relation to large databases or data warehouses. Ability to work autonomously and to take responsibility for delivering data-related governance/compliance decisions and recommendations with minimal supervision. Significant experience of handling activities across many varied functional disciplines (e.g. marketing, risk, finance), analysing complex processes and factors in order to arrive at solutions. Experience in a similar functional role managing data quality and data provisioning standards. Ability to manage and influence stakeholders at senior levels across varied functional teams. An understanding and working knowledge of the financial services industry and relevant policies and standards. Ability to engage with technical data experts as well as non-technical.
