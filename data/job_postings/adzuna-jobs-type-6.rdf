When we are unwell we have to go and see a doctor even for the simplest of conditions. Your.MD believes that technology can be used to help people take the best course of action when they are not well. Should I see a doctor? Should I wait a few days to see if I am better? Should I take antibiotics? Do I need an X-Ray? These are the type of questions we think Artificial Intelligence can help answering in a very reliable way. We are launching a new version of our service later this year and we are confident we will draw a line in the sand for digital health services going forward. Our team comprises some of the best people in their respective fields and we are not going to stop until we have managed to put free basic health advice in the hands of a billion people around the world. This is the F1 of startups so if you think you are one of the best, get in touch.</ns1:description>

You&apos;ll also need experience of working with large data sets - any work with the likes of Netezza, Teradata, Oracle etc would be a real bonus. Whilst you will have an amazing array of technical expertise required, you&apos;ll need to be switched on commercially. Let&apos;s face it, it&apos;s fantastic if you can write a fancy SQL script that will pump millions of rows into a data warehouse in a few minutes, but if you don&apos;t know why you&apos;re doing this for our client, there&apos;s a problem. You&apos;ll be contributing to our clients commercial success by providing in depth analysis, using your problem solving skills which should be second-to-none, and utilising your passion for data and insight. If you think you&apos;ve got what it takes, then please read on... What you will do: You will load data (ETL / scripting) from multiple operational systems into our clients Data Lake, and combine this data in ways that have not been possible or done before You will be using your strong scripting skills to pick up Hadoop / Hive for data loading and transformation You&apos;ll be part of a dynamic development team, so you&apos;ll need to be supportive and want to work collaboratively to achieve our clients goals and objectives Build data migration scripts to take all data stores in the cluster from one release to the next, without loss of data Your skills &amp; experience.. Experience of developing reliable, maintainable, efficient code in most of SQL, Linux shell, Java and Python You should want to learn new skills and tools in the Hadoop Data Platform, who wouldn&apos;t want to?! But if you have previous experience with Hadoop, we REALLY want to hear from you You will have a habit of thorough developer testing as-well as discipline of working with a ticketing system You will ideally have an understanding of UNIX systems, especially Linux. If you are a Data Warehouse Engineer / ETL Developer / Big Data Tech Lead, you will appreciate that this is a rare and exceptional opportunity to learn skills with the Hadoop Data Platform, only one of the hottest technologies in our market right now with a company who take all things data extremely seriously!

<ns1:description>.NET Developer - An original, exciting job opportunity in Grimsby! C# ASP.Net / Perm / Fantastic Salary Are you looking for a innovative .NET software environment in a company that trains and invests constantly in their staff? That gives &quot;free time&quot; in work to their developers to learn, experience and implement the latest technologies? If this is the kind a role you are after then I am working with a .NET house in Grimsby that would be perfect! They would love to interview a .NET Developer who has a lot of ideas, but for whatever reason has not been able to execute and realise them where they are now. They offer a cutting edge .NET technical environment where investigating the latest tools is encouraged - as such all their .NET developers have strong skills with the Responsive Design stack (HTML5, CSS3, Knockout.js and Backbone.js). The company are currently playing around with other tools such as RabbitMQ and SignalR, to see if they can add value to their existing product ranges and have pushed ahead with Xamarin to create cross-platform mobile applications. They also do some really interesting stuff with Big Data, working with the latest NoSQL technologies like MongoDB and DynamoDB, as well as the more traditional SQL Server back-end and even do work in the cloud using the AWS platform. They also have their last Web Forms conversion project into ASP.NET MVC5, RESTful Services and Web APIs - so if you are looking gain experience in these areas - it&apos;s the ideal time to join!

<ns1:description>BI Manager - Leeds - ?600 a day - 6 - 12 Months An experienced business intelligence manager is required to head up my clients mid-sized team of BI specialists, and take control of operational and strategic duties across a wider project based development function when required. Although this is not a hands-on role, the BI manager must have a technical background and a solid understanding of Business Intelligence products and technologies. Part of the remit of this role includes improving the status and perception of the Business Intelligence function within the business; so a passion and enthusiasm for BI and an ability to speak authoritatively on it&apos;s capabilities and benefits (to an end-user) is essential. The BI manager must have a background in one of the mainstream BI platforms (ideally Cognos or SQL / Microsoft BI) but must also be open minded to new technologies and interested/experienced in new product evaluation selection. An interest in emerging technologies would also be useful - big data &amp; real-time BI is something being discussed and considered by my client at the moment and the BI manager would be expected to drive this idea forward in the business if the benefits appear significant. The BI manager must have experience of: -&gt; leading teams of BI &amp; database developers -&gt; growing / recruiting additional technical staff -&gt; managing technical projects and product implementations across the full project life-cycle -&gt; managing senior stakeholders and customer/client relationships For more information please contact Hemant Sabharwal on 0161 817 7888 and/or submit a current CV as soon as possible.</ns1:description>
