<ns1:description>Software House in Glasgow, market leaders in their field, require multiple .NET Software Engineers/Senior Software Engineers to join them as they build on their past successes and work on new, undoubtedly market-leading, products for their impressive list of clients. The organisation are a well-established and highly-regarded technology company - their Glasgow base is the company&apos;s UK Centre of Technical Excellence, with the technical team totalling around 100. They are a trusted supplier of software products to many household names (their client list is very impressive) and build robust, cloud-based applications which help their customers manage business processes. They have recently celebrated their 50th anniversary - and are now looking to the future; ambitious plans are underway! The team are working on a new product - which has already had massive interest from their existing clients and new clients. There is therefore a huge amount of interesting, technically challenging work on Greenfield projects. In addition to strong technical skills, you should have strong communication skills - the organisation favour a communicative and collaborative working style. When bringing a new Software Developer into the team, personality is as important as technical prowess - you&apos;ll therefore be working with a really great group of people! Their offices are in an easily accessible part of Glasgow - with ample parking and good public transport links. Your skills: *C#, ASP.NET application development. *Strong database skills; SQL Server. *Good communication skills and the ability to work as part of a team. I am very interested to speak to skilled Microsoft Developers in Glasgow - if you&apos;re keen to stretch yourself and work with an incredibly bright (but friendly!) team, then please do get in touch! Either apply or call Rhona Kennedy on 0131 510 1500.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Our Client is looking for an experienced and qualified mechanical services draughtsman for an immediate start. A good design and site (i.e real world experience, not theoretical) knowledge is required but design qualifications are not essential. Our ideal candidate would have at least 2 years recent experience working for a mechanical services contractor in the commercial/industrial sector who has trained as a design draughtsman and is used to producing ductwork installation drawings for site and manufacture drawings compliant with DW144 standards. The candidate will have qualifications in 2D AutoCAD as a minimum but will need to demonstrate that they are more than just a CAD operator by providing evidence/references of actual mechanical services draughting skills. MEP Revit and BIM knowledge would be an advantage but not essential. They will also need to be punctual, dedicated to achieving targets under pressure and be willing to put in additional hours (within reason) as required for the achievement of deadlines imposed by our Clients from time to time.

<ns1:description>Position:           QA Engineer Location:         Southampton Salary:              ?30K - ?35K Job purpose     To oversee, monitor, maintain and improve the technical quality of software and systems produced by the technical team(s). Principal objectives       This role splits into three key areas: general technical responsibilities, role-specific responsibilities and personal objectives. General technical responsibilities: To be an integrated and effective member of the technical team, being able to help and support others, as well as suggesting new/improved technologies and methodologies as appropriate. Act as a technical contact to provide support to the research team, and relate technical concepts clearly and effectively. To learn and exhibit in depth knowledge of relevant components of the systems and their application to business needs. To plan ones’ own time and communicate proactively (both verbally and in writing) so that agreed deadlines are met and stakeholder expectations are managed. To capitalise on ones’ growing experience to ensure that tasks are being completed as efficiently as possible. Role-specific responsibilities: Generally, to manage and maintain the technical quality of systems.  Technical quality means bug rates, security issues, and robustness. Maintain and develop the testing infrastructure (including unit tests). Implement and maintain tests. Review existing code and update for current coding conventions and correctness. Review new code submissions across the team for quality; liaising with developers, identifying and fixing issues and improving overall quality and robustness as appropriate. Continuously review development practises, conventions, guidelines, procedures and rules – proposing and implementing improvements where necessary to improve technical quality. Evangelise quality, testing and effective development practises to the team. Personal objectives: Personal objectives are designed to stretch the job holder in order to facilitate career progression or to target an area for specific improvement. They are mutually agreed in each review. Planning and organising  The job holder must be able to self-manage and enthusiastically “own” their tasks with effective communication of their progress to stakeholders and on-going support of their features. We expect the job holder to be able to effectively focus on one task at a time and to accurately estimate timelines, factoring in appropriate contingency time. Decisions  The job holder will be given the chance to provide input into the technologies and tools that they will use to achieve the job roles. The job holder will be given the freedom to decide the technical design underpinning a task that they have been given as long as it sits within the Company’s overall design goals. Contact with others       The job holder will have significant contact with all members of the team, however most contact will be with other members of the technical team. Contact within the technical team will be day-to-day to facilitate support, sharing of best practises and peer code review. Contact with the research team will be required to fully understand requirements, to provide on-going support for the engineers’ own components, and to evangelise quality and testing. Occasionally the job holder may be required to liaise with clients via email, phone or in person when accompanied by a senior staff member in order to gain a deeper understanding of requirements and issues. Greatest challenge         To adopt the “strategic approach” when choosing an implementation plan so developments are always made in a generic, and therefore reusable, way. Knowledge/Skills/Experience    At least 3 years commercial experience in a similar role. Ability to accurately estimate timescales. Ability to abstract away from detail, keeping developed solutions as generic as possible. Strong attention to detail, and an investigatory and methodical approach. Experience in developing using PHP5 or later. Adept at Object Oriented programming methodologies. Some experience with PostgreSQL DBMS is advantageous. Experience with PHPUnit, Selenium and similar testing platforms is advantageous. Contact: Joanne Senior Reference: Totaljobs/226554 Job ID: 64111802</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>3rd Line Network Manager / Engineer (3-6 months, potential temp to perm) PLEASE NOTE: The company is based in a fairly remote location without good public transport links so you must be able to drive and have your own transport to be considered. Working as the preferred recruiter on behalf of a fast moving, dynamic company based in Stratford upon Avon, I am currently recruiting for an experienced Microsoft 3rd Line Network Manager / Engineer to join them in a critical role. Working in a small team, you will support and manage their existing server/network environment as well as being involved in various IT projects as the company looks to update and improve their infrastructure. Initially the role will mainly revolve around dealing with high level technical support issues, before moving onto project work and systems admin duties. Longer term, there is likely to be the opportunity to move into a perm IT Manager / Senior Systems Administrator role paying around the ?45k level. The company’s environment consists of the technologies below (though this isn’t a comprehensive list): • Microsoft Windows 7 • Microsoft Exchange 2013 • Microsoft SharePoint 2010/13 • Microsoft Lync 2010/13 • Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011/13 • Microsoft NAV 2013 R2 • Windows 2008/12 R2 • Hyper-V Cluster/ iSCSI SAN. • Cisco network (wired and wireless). You will ideally be familiar with most of the technologies mentioned above with Microsoft Windows Server 2008/12, Exchange and networking experience being absolutely essential. This role would not suit applicants with mainly 2nd line experience as the hiring manager would prefer someone who has worked in a 3rd line / Senior Network Engineer capacity, or previously as an IT Manager / Systems Administrator within a small/medium sized company where the technical responsibilities are varied. This particular line manager has asked me to give preference to people with a stable (9 months+) contract or perm backgrounds, as opposed to contractors with recent multiple short term contracts. The role is initially offered on a 3 month contract that is likely to extend to 6 months or become permanent for the right person. On offer is a rate between ?225-?300 per day (?30-?40 per hour). This is an urgent role so if you think you are suitable please apply for a guaranteed, personal reply. Rebel Recruitment are equal opportunities recruiters. 3rd Line Network Manager / Engineer (3-6 months, potential temp to perm)</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Job Introduction The myBBC project was created to ensure the BBC was able to offer a different, more personalised service to each of our audience members, to run alongside the brilliant broadcast service we currently have. To do that, we need to collect data on that audience. Data about what they love watching, reading and listening to; when and where they love doing that; and about the kind of things they choose to share and comment on. In return we will be able to offer personalised suggestions about what we know they&apos;ll love to watch, read or listen to, and notify them when it&apos;s available; one that remembers key information like what their favourites are across all their devices, and where they live so they automatically receive localised information like weather and traffic reports.

<ns1:description>7digital aims to simplify access to the world’s music and radio. Our robust, scalable digital music platform and flexible APIs are used to power comprehensive music and radio services for leading consumer brands, mobile carriers, broadcasters, automotive systems, retailers, record labels, artists and agencies. Alongside proven technology, we offer global music rights, award-winning radio production services, and content management expertise, making us a leading global partner in this space. Right now we are engaged in a number of very exciting wearable projects for will.i.am (we&apos;re the music on his Puls watch), hi-res audio services for Onkyo and Meridian, along with developing streaming products for ROK Mobile and Guvera. About this job: We need an experienced Web Operations / Systems Engineer with a high level knowledge in servers, Cisco networking, operating systems and ideally operating services in the cloud who is keen to work on a high availability and high demand system – in a collaborative manner – building a robust, resilient and automated platform which can cope with scaling up to meet an ever increasing demand: Our infrastructure is handling around 500 requests per second (and growing). Half the organisation is made up of tech people (Systems, Developers, DBAs, QAs), and the other half is actually a pretty friendly bunch and nice to work with! We’re massive fans of the DevOps movement, we organise regular events in the office and aim to keep the right focus in a fast moving industry with a very agile development team. We&apos;re running ~70% Linux but also have some Windows (for the moment anyway) – we’re pretty technology agnostic. The work opportunities are broad: We manage most of our own hardware and network and we have a lot of it (500-ish units). We run our own virtualised environments. We&apos;ve been going automation crazy (with tests and everything). It&apos;s making us happier and more productive. We’re making greater use of IaaS &amp; PaaS such as Amazon AWS.  We are currently moving our data centre to cloud over the next 6 months to move to cloud data services using AWS containerised in Docker on Linux. We have many sophisticated products and applications and are making better use of technologies like Nginx, HAProxy and Varnish within them (rather than coding our way out of every challenge). Day-to-day, this job will involve Working in a highly collaborative manner with everyone in the organisation, particularly our other technical staff. Improving the way we collaborate and get things done. Making occasional visits to our data centres to do things we can’t do remotely. About you (take your pick, the more the better): You have a proven track record in a Systems Administration/Server Engineer role. You&apos;ve worked in a product driven environment. You are aware of DevOps, what it means and want to work in an environment where the collaboration and team interactions make this happen. You know the importance of monitoring and have experience configuring and managing monitoring tools. You have hands on experience with server build automation. You&apos;re experienced with configuring network devices and routing. You&apos;ve experience with handling a lot of storage (think Petabytes) You love Linux, but you don’t think Windows inherently is evil. You have experience with database/search infrastructure. You’re experienced with maintaining high availability and high demand systems. You care about you being better, your team being better and your company being better. You enjoy working with other people outside of IT operations. Technologies: You don’t need to know them all, but if you have experience with many of these, things are looking promising. OS: Debian Linux, Windows Server 2008R2/2012 Web servers, proxies and Caches: Nginx, IIS, Varnish, HAProxy Automation: We use Chef &amp; some CFEngine (+ other things). Hardware: Dell, Cisco, Juniper Cloud computing: Amazon AWS, Azure Monitoring: Zabbix, New Relic, Logstash, Kibana, Graphite, StatsD Source Control: Git, Subversion CI/CD: Jenkins, TeamCity Database/document stores: SQL Server, Mongodb, elasticsearch, Solr Storage: GlusterFS Other important tech: Debian Package Management, KVM, ASP.NET, PowerDNS, RackTables Other tech you might run into, but not daily: Apache, Exim, SFTP, ProFTPd, MySQL, Samba To apply for this positon please submit your CV online.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>A market leading Machinery OEM is currently looking to employ a controls engineer to take on new design work at their site near Stevenage. The company specialise in the design and manufacture of Automated Machinery that measures and gauges Engines for the automotive sector, required high precision tolerancing and calibration services. Off the back of consistently performing with an excellent reputation, they have won a number of projects for a leading road car manufacturer and, as a result, require an additional Control Engineer who can design and programme (ideally in S7), modifications or new machines from scratch. While there will be a breaking in period in which you will have assistance in the work you are doing, ultimately, the client is looking for someone who can step up and lead Electrical development work for certain projects. This makes this an excellent opportunity for a Controls Engineer with a few years&apos; experience who is looking to gain more experience in the sector. The client utilises S7 software, though any software experience will be considered as long as you have a good understanding of IEC standards. A relevant candidate will also have experience in the design of Special Purpose Machinery and be able to design using AutoCAD or other Electrical Software. If this is a position that you feel you would be a good fit for then please send me your CV by uploading it on the link provided or by emailing me directly. Alternatively, if you would like additional information on this role then don&apos;t hesitate to call me on 01179388088 to discuss further. As this is an urgent position within the business, interviews can be scheduled at relative ease so, if interested, it is imperative that you call me or get your CV in front of me ASAP. Looking forward to hearing from you.</ns1:description>

If so then read on Huxley Engineering are currently recruiting on behalf of a Hitchin based Machinery design and build company for a control systems engineer. Having met the client on multiple occasions in the last few years, it is clear to see that this is a company that are looking to grow and realise their ambitions of becoming the leading supplier of automated machinery to the industry, and it is also clear to see that they have the reputation and capability to fully push the business forward. Operating within the Automotive sector, my client are renowned for the high precision of software that they develop. Having the capacity to on board and develop less experienced Controls Engineers also make this a company that will scale their growth to affect their needs. It is rare in engineering to find a company that have such a clear plan of where they want to be with a full appreciation of where they have come from and this company absolutely fills that criteria. What they are looking for is a Control Systems Engineer who is hungry to learn and develop with the business but who has a good foundation knowledge in Control Systems Engineering. 2-5 years experience will suffice with a relevant degree, the company use Siemens as their PLC but they will consider people who have used other commercial PLCs as long as the understanding of IEC control standards is there. This is a competitive opportunity with interview able to be arranged as soon as you are available so, if you are looking for this kind of opportunity, give me a call on 01179388088 and ask for Joshua Shaw or email/upload your CV on the link provided and I will be happy to give you a call.

<ns1:description>Trading System Software Engineer Location: London, City Salary: circa 70-100k base though negotiable Case by case + benefits + strong trading house bonuses. A rapidly growing global quantitative / prop trading house is looking to strengthen its London office and hire a Trading Software Engineer with DevOps type responsibilities (development and support) to help enhance and maintain their growing European high frequency trading infrastructure and associated market data systems (c++/c# environment). Because the business are around a dozen people in London (basically all are technologists) the role is not pigeon holed and the engineer will be involved in the development, automation, monitoring, support and improvement of these business critical systems. The role is therefore multi dimensional and will give the individual fantastic business exposure as well as technical exposure. The technical environment is c++ Linux for the trading systems and libraries and then predominately c# Microsoft stack for the core systems. The software engineer can come from any development background (ideally mixed but not essential) as long as they are happy and keen to cross train, (eg they have had a Java developer cross train into c# and a dev ops engineer develop more programming skills in c++). Ideal skills / experience: - Strong Background in development principles in any language (eg c++, c# or java etc) with strong hands on programming ability and design knowledge. Linux / UNIX OS environment. - Ability to automate, deploy and monitor a range of real time complex applications and trading systems. Can own technical projects and follow a test driven development process. - Strong troubleshooting abilities, inquisitive nature with an eye for detail and spotting potential incidents and owning problem solving for complex, high performance technical environment. The team are made up of highly passionate technologists who are given license to push technology to its limits in order to maximise trade frequency and latency stability within the proprietary trading area. The working environment is very relaxed, casual dress, free lunches, opportunities to travel to the U.S. Offices now and then (can be as little as once a year if not of interest). Every candidate they have offered in the past has accepted and the only person to leave the business was headhunted into Google. This role will be ideal for a Software Developer / Engineer who enjoys a broad role with lots of technical challenges and to work for an environment that not only embraces technology but exists because of technology and therefore empower their technologists to do more with it.</ns1:description>
