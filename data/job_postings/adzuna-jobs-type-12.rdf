<ns1:description>VB.Net / C# Developer Here at Rebel Recruitment we only work with companies we are proud to represent. Companies that treat their people well; have interesting and complex projects, and where people can genuinely develop their skills and careers. Working with one such company, I am looking for a VB.Net developer to join a growing development team based in Derby. I have been asked to look for someone with the following skills: • ASP.Net • VB.Net / C# • JavaScript • JQuery • CSS • T-SQL The company is currently rewriting their existing desktop-based software in to ASP.Net using the VB.Net syntax. In the longer run they are hoping to migrate the project over to C#, but only after they have achieved a stable release version in its current state. So this would be a great chance to cross-train to C# later down the road. They’ve told us that because they’re replicating a desktop product, you’ll need to be creative in how you deliver some of the functionality; they are trying to provide existing users with a similar experience to the desktop offering, whilst using the advantage of the web environment as well. The role is expected to be broken down to be 20% of your time on support and the rest on development- with this being a mix of maintaining the product, developing new features, and looking at new products. The company has a relaxed, casual atmosphere, which is reflected in their dress code! So there’s no need to feel uncomfortable while you’re developing their next amazing product! Also, there is quite a ‘family feel’ to the place as it’s a smaller company, and so the opportunity to bounce ideas of each other, learn from each, etc is massive. The salary on offer is up to the ?32k mark (depending on experience), plus benefits including 22 days holiday, 3% matched pension, private health care, 4 x salary death in service benefit, long term illness income protection scheme. There is ample on-site parking. The role is based in Derbyshire. If you think you’d be a good match for the role, please apply now, or to find out more about it, please feel free to call the number above. Rebel Recruitment is an equal opportunities recruitment company. You must, however, be authorized to live and work in the UK.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Software Developer, C#, Oxford (Central) A leading Software House based in the heart of Oxford seeks a Software Developer to join their growing team. Working in a newly created position, you’ll be working on new projects from day one, getting involved in the ongoing development and cutting code! The Company This is a company that knows how to look after their developers. The staff retention rates are testament to the quality of environment and the challenge that’s on offer with my client. People rarely leave. The projects for the right Software Developer are varied and challenging with some tough technical issues to tackle and overcome. However, as the Software Developer, you won’t be facing these challenges alone but instead you’ll be part of a great team! The Role The first thing to mention with the role is that no two projects will be exactly the same. Thus, the range of languages used is extensive. Most of the projects involve C#. ASP.NET, MVC and SQL Server but exposure to JS and other OO languages would be highly beneficial. The most important thing that you’ll need to bring is an interest and willingness to learn and pick up new languages, embracing the training opportunities that will present themselves. Who will I work with? Working with some nice guys who love what they do. It’s a diverse, welcoming environment that’s perfect for new comers! Geek nights, beer nights and the stereotypical pizza are also thrown in. You’ll also work with some excellent developers who will be happy to show you the ropes and see if they can improve your skills. These guys love what they do and work hard but work together to get things done. Sound right? What do you think? We’d be keen to hear from you, discuss your application and find out more about you AND tell you all about what we’re working on. Feel free to reach out on the phone or just apply and we’ll go from there.
