<ns1:description>The Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL), situated in Grenoble, France, is Europe&apos;s leading research facility for fundamental research using neutrons. The ILL operates the brightest neutron source in the world, and welcomes 2000 visiting scientists per year to carry out world-class research in a wide variety of scientific fields. The best Ultra Cold Neutron (UCN) sources currently deliver densities in the order of just a few tens of neutrons per cubic centimetre. As a result many fundamental physics projects are hampered by counting statistical limits. The aim of the SuperSUN project is to improve previous UCN storage time constants dramatically and produce a world record polarized UCN density of more than 1000 per cm3. This project is funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR). Our Science Division currently has a vacancy for a: Mechanical Engineering Draftsperson (M/F) Duties: As a member of the Advanced Neutron Environment team, you will work with scientists and cryogenics experts from the ILL and produce drawings of the UCN source cryostats and extractor that will be designed and assembled in-house. Your work will include: producing detailed drawings of the main cryostat (superfluid He production), providing innovative solutions for the design of the interface between the main cryostat, the UCN converter and the extractor, interfacing with suppliers and preparing calls for tender. Qualifications and experience: You have an NVQ Level 4 or equivalent qualification (e.g. BTEC HND) in Mechanical engineering or equivalent and some professional experience. A good hands-on knowledge of SolidWorks is required. Language skills: As an international research centre, we are particularly keen to ensure that we also attract applicants from outside France. You must have a sound knowledge of English and be willing to learn French (a language course will be paid for by the ILL). Knowledge of German would be an advantage. Notes: This post is an 8-month fixed-term contract. Medical fitness for work under ionising radiation is required. Benefits: Generous company benefits (expatriation allowance), relocation assistance and language courses may be offered for you and your spouse (for more information, please consult our employment conditions). How to apply: Please submit your application on-line, no later than 07.12.2015 by clicking the &apos;Apply&apos; button (vacancy reference: 15/21).

<ns1:jobTitle>E-Fate SD - move to regulatory affairs - excellent training</ns1:jobTitle>
<ns1:description>A very rare opportunity for an environmental fate or environmental metabolism study director / scientist to move from the laboratory to a desk based risk assessment and regulatory affairs role. It is essential that you have a strong understanding of environmental fate data - its source and how it is to be used. You will benefit from being trained by EU recognised Environmental Risk assessment and E-fate modelling experts. You will be able to make the transition from the lab to the next level - modelling the data, conducting risk assessments and completing environmental fate registration dossiers. Suitable candidates must have proven experience in an environmental fate or environmental metabolism laboratory running (ideally GLP) studies to investigate the behaviour of compounds in the environment. You must have a strong understanding of environmental fate data generation and ideally the GLP requirements for environmental fate laboratory studies. You must be able to demonstrate a strong interest and motivation to move into a desk based risk assessment / regulatory affairs role. An interest in environmental fate modelling is particularly relevant - any experience of lower tier (or higher tier) e-fate modelling would be a benefit, although is not essential. Full training will be provided. For further information and an immediate confidential discussion, contact John Sherratt at VRS Regulatory. Key Skills: Environmental Fate, environmental metabolism, GLP, lab studies, study director, study scientist, interest in risk assessment, interest in regulatory affairs / dossier preparation, environmental fate modelling. VRS Regulatory is the Regulatory Affairs and Risk Assessment division of specialist scientific recruiter VRS. We focus on recruitment in Regulatory Affairs, Registrations, REACH, CLP, SDS Authoring, Product Safety, Compliance, Risk Assessment, Regulatory Toxicology, Regulatory Ecotoxicology and Environmental Fate in the chemicals, agrochemicals and biocides sectors.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Are you ready to build an e-Commerce proposition from a blank sheet of paper? We want to grow our Genomics division and to do that we need the ability to be able to promote and sell our products across a range of e-Commerce channels. This really is a great opportunity for someone who has a background in the Life Sciences or Genomics industry and has expertise of putting together e-Commerce and Digital campaigns. This isn’t a technical position, you would work closely with the IT Team to provide them direction, but it is not essential to have come from an IT background. This is what the first 3 to 6 months will probably look like: Get to know our business and products Ask yourself “How do I increase sales via e-Commerce? Build the strategy to answer the above question Understand the technology implications Work closely with the Genomics MD, Group CIO and wider business Realistically, we need someone who has a background in “our world” (Life Science or Genomics). Reason being is our products are very niche and specific and having conversations with our Scientists would be difficult without this knowledge. Also, we need you to understand the e-Commerce market, this is going to be a position where you are responsible for Product Management, e-Marketing, Digital Channels, Strategy, so you have to know your stuff and roll your sleeves up. Going beyond 6 months, it’s all about the customer engagement, implementation, continuous improvement, keeping up to date with the pace of e-Commerce. It really is once in a lifetime position to define your career! So, are you ready? Contact: Ben Rodrigues Reference: Totaljobs/e-comgenomics Job ID: 64109971</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Now recruiting for our 2016 programs! Location: Reading, UK (Home based considered) People don’t come to PRA to witness the future of clinical development. They come to shape it. They’re creators and developers, scientists and managers. They explore and build, nurture and rebel, think and dream. It’s the dichotomy of our people that makes them different. It’s our people that make us unique. At PRA we don’t make our people great. It’s the other way around. We find exceptional people and empower and encourage them. Or maybe, because we empower and encourage them, exceptional people find us. Whichever way it happens, the combination is truly awesome, and the results speak for themselves. Position Overview: PRA are looking for the next generation of Clinical Research Professionals to join their growing Clinical Operations team in the UK. We are recruiting for experienced Study Coordinators and Research Nurses to join the PRA Bridge Training Program. You will join our comprehensive PRA Bridge training program which will enable you to learn initially within a classroom setting (based at the Reading office) before moving to work on your own studies with continuing support, training and mentorship. Desired skills and qualifications: In order to be considered, you will need have an undergraduate degree or its international equivalent in clinical, science, or health-related field from an accredited institution; a licensed health-care professional (i.e: registered nurse) or equivalent work experience. We are looking for self-motivated applicants who have exceptional inter-personal skills, and have the ability to learn new tasks and processes quickly in a fast-paced and dynamic environment. You will be tenacious, have high standards of quality with a keen eye for detail and the ability to prioritise and multi task. Fluency in English is required. Together with a competitive salary, we offer a comprehensive range of benefits and an excellent working environment. As we continue to expand, there will be career opportunities on a truly global scale. PRA Health Sciences is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We welcome and encourage diversity in the workplace.</ns1:description>
