This role is focused on a large Hadoop based Enterprise Data Platform which will be used to provide data insights to our clients internal teams and customers - whilst you don&apos;t need Hadoop experience, you will be trained up in this area. To be considered, you will need to be a hands on &quot;Data Geek&quot; who is currently very close to the technology, and really knows their stuff when it comes to Data Loading, ETL, Integration and Migration. You&apos;ll also need experience of working with large data sets - any work with the likes of Netezza, Teradata, Oracle etc would be a real bonus. Whilst you will have an amazing array of technical expertise required, you&apos;ll need to be switched on commercially. Let&apos;s face it, it&apos;s fantastic if you can write a fancy SQL script that will pump millions of rows into a data warehouse in a few minutes, but if you don&apos;t know why you&apos;re doing this for our client, there&apos;s a problem. You&apos;ll be contributing to our clients commercial success by providing in depth analysis, using your problem solving skills which should be second-to-none, and utilising your passion for data and insight. If you think you&apos;ve got what it takes, then please read on... What you will do: You will load data (ETL / scripting) from multiple operational systems into our clients Data Lake, and combine this data in ways that have not been possible or done before You will be using your strong scripting skills to pick up Hadoop / Hive for data loading and transformation You&apos;ll be part of a dynamic development team, so you&apos;ll need to be supportive and want to work collaboratively to achieve our clients goals and objectives Build data migration scripts to take all data stores in the cluster from one release to the next, without loss of data Your skills &amp; experience.. Experience of developing reliable, maintainable, efficient code in most of SQL, Linux shell, Java and Python You should want to learn new skills and tools in the Hadoop Data Platform, who wouldn&apos;t want to?! But if you have previous experience with Hadoop, we REALLY want to hear from you You will have a habit of thorough developer testing as-well as discipline of working with a ticketing system You will ideally have an understanding of UNIX systems, especially Linux. If you are a Data Warehouse Engineer / ETL Developer / Big Data Tech Lead, you will appreciate that this is a rare and exceptional opportunity to learn skills with the Hadoop Data Platform, only one of the hottest technologies in our market right now with a company who take all things data extremely seriously!
