<ns1:description>An international chemicals business are initiating a project to deliver the next generation of HR services and seek a person to fulfil the task of business case lead. The scope of the project covers HR, Payroll and associated service and will include looking at the current business organisation (internal and vendors), processes and systems. We are establishing the project team in Manchester and wish to appoint someone to take responsibility for the development of the business case. The appointee will be responsible for capturing the baseline data about the current operation of the relevant business processes, building a cost model that supports them and then working with the solution architect and systems providers to understand the cost of change and the potential benefits to be derived. We are looking for someone with an established track record of supporting such a technologically-enabled change project in a large corporate organisation. We expect the successful candidate to be able to demonstrate capability and understanding in the following areas: Business case development: A full understanding of the analytical techniques required to design the analytical model, identify the sources and means of data capture (including activity sampling), populate the model and evaluate the options. It is expected that the successful candidate will play the major part in carrying out these activities. HR Transformation: An understanding of the approaches to building a world class HR service delivery model based on a demonstrable grasp of HR business processes and their implications for the business. Options development: The ability to support the formulation of options for consideration and identify the implementation implications of each. Analysis and modelling skills in large scale business projects. As this is a technologically enabled change project, an understanding of IT applications and their dependencies will be required sufficient to identify, understand and analyse the impact on the project. It is likely the successful candidate will have demonstrable analytical capability that will have been earned in a financial or analytical environment. They will be part of an initial programme team of four and report to the HR Next Generation Programme Lead.

<ns1:description>Overview My client is now seeking more IT Support Analysts in their lucrative (Graduate) IT Support Team. They currently require candidates with a bit of experience already since graduation:- Are you a UK based 2:1 / A Levels (or BTEC National) graduate (with between 1 year and 4 years’ experience since graduation) looking for a proper opportunity in IT? My client researches investment ideas to predict price returns in financial markets across multiple asset classes. They also develop the research and execution platform to deploy these ideas in markets globally. Their investment research, software and IT Systems are used to drive this Quantitative Hedge Fund to the next level. Their software and services are used in markets around the globe and around the clock. They offer a dynamic, flexible and highly stimulating working environment, where good ideas are prized and rewarded correspondingly. They now seek an experienced Graduate IT Support Analyst (Windows Server based) to work within the Systems team. All members of the team have an agreed amount of time to spend on project work and training. From day one the IT Support Analyst will be dealing with a huge range of technologies and take on responsibility in looking after the systems and responding to alerts. Key Tasks Monitoring complex in-house systems and our automated trading systems Windows Active Directory and Microsoft Exchange management VMware ESX virtual infrastructure Desktop PC upgrades and deployments Server upgrades and deployments Windows Server and Workstation hardware, diagnostics and repair Security issues and improvements, including boundary protection, physical security and AV alerts Software upgrades, including trading and general infra applications Backup infrastructure and disaster recovery plans Automated software packaging and build system Perl scripts and PowerShell Cmdlets to automate daily tasks This is very much a hands-on technical role and provides an excellent learning experience for a graduate IT Support Analyst wanting to move further into the field of systems administration in a Windows Server based environment. The graduate IT Support Analyst works closely alongside senior team members who will be able to help with advice, troubleshooting, training and project work; the opportunities for learning are huge. The graduate IT Support Analyst role will suit someone who has a real interest in infrastructure, and a demonstrable aptitude for applying computing concepts and their skills to solve real problems. Experience/Qualifications The graduate IT Support Analyst will be bright, driven and energetic with a passion for technology. The right candidate should have a computing or sciences degree with 1-4 years&apos; experience. Financial institution experience in a trading environment is preferable but not required. The company has high academic hiring standards and requires degree qualified candidates with a 2:1 degree or higher and 3 A-Levels equivalent to BCC although a BTEC equivalent will be considered (260 UCAS Points Minimum). IT Support Analysts at the company range from 1st class Computer Science graduates, to Business graduates with a year’s technical experience, to Engineering graduates with a PhD. One thing they all have in common is a drive, love and motivation for technology, new concepts and new ideas to solve complicated problems. Experience of Windows 7 desktop and Windows 2008 Server, server and workstation hardware, scripting, backup infrastructure, Linux infrastructure, networking and major desktop applications such as Microsoft Office will all be of benefit, but not essential if the right calibre of individual walks through the door. All in all – a top graduate IT Support opportunity with solid progression prospects. # Graduate IT Support Windows IT Support Analyst</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>The Company My client is a firmly established technology driven Quantitative Hedge Fund located in the Central London area. Information Technology is a core growth area and the technical challenges and breadth of technology exposure will be attractive to candidates wishing to be part of a dynamic team that will present them with a stimulating environment. The IT Systems group is growing and the company wishes to find outstanding individuals who can contribute to this group. There are a broad range of technologies and systems in use, and the group supports an advanced, high-pressure trading environment. The Role The client is seeking a Network Support Analyst to join the Network Operations team in the IT Operations group. The group is responsible for day to day operation of the company’s technical infrastructure. The Network Operations team is responsible for the company’s global network infrastructure covering office, datacentre and colocation sites. The team is fairly small but is growing and broadening the scope of the network infrastructure that it takes responsibility for. Although all IT Operations group members are expected to be familiar in all aspects of the company’s infrastructure, each one has a particular area of expertise. The role will mainly focus on the day-to-day monitoring, support and troubleshooting of the network infrastructure. The Network Support Analyst role will cover the following main areas: : Performing general network changes such as provisioning switch ports and updating access control lists. : Logging circuit outages with third party vendors and working with them to identify a reason for outage and ensure the stability of the service they are providing. : Manage third party maintenance notifications and where necessary take appropriate actions to ensure continuity of service to the business. : Monitor the health of the network infrastructure using an array of network monitoring and analysis tools. : Investigate hardware and software problems with network devices and work with the manufacturers’ support teams to resolve. : Testing and troubleshooting network connectivity to third party trading partners. As well as working alongside the Network Engineering team the Network Support Analyst will be working in close interaction with the Infrastructure, Datacentre and IT Operations teams so there is a broad exposure to a variety of enterprise products and technologies. The Individual It will be important for the successful Network Support Analyst to have a good understanding of enterprise network technologies and protocols and evidence of strong problem solving skills is important. Ideally this will be backed by a CCNA qualification to demonstrate knowledge of basic switching and routing concepts and familiarity with configuring and operating Cisco switches and routers.

The company has high academic hiring standards and requires candidates with a 2:1 degree in a related subject or better and good A-Levels or equivalents. If you are an ambitious Network Support Analyst, looking to take a step into the lucrative Hedge Fund scene working with top class people and bleeding edge technologies then we are very keen to hear from you. # Cisco CCNA Network Analyst</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Test Analysts with 1 to 3 years experience (manual or automation) are sought by this technology-driven FTSE100 company to join a Software Developer In Test Academy Class they are planning to start at the beginning of January. This Academy Class will be a well funded, structured training session for a period of 6 months where technologists who have a passion for QA and automating as much of the test process as possible will be trained to become Software Developers In Test. At the end of the 6 months training this role will be automatically converted into a permanent position, with the job title &quot;Software Developer in Test&quot; WHAT IS A &quot;SOFTWARE DEVELOPER IN TEST&quot;? &quot;A Software Developer in test… is a QA but the focus is on writing automated tests rather than on creating and running manual test cases. Think of it as writing software to test software. It can be a particularly challenging career choice because it takes both programming skill and a good understanding of software testing.&quot; So in summary its: - A QA - who can write Java code - and use that code to write software to test software WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? In many technology-driven company QA ends up being the poor relation to the development team. However at this FTSE100 company they want their SDIT career path to be just as prestigious and as enviable as a developer career path. So they have beefed up their own existing SDiT team with seniors from Amazon and Google at the higher end of the corporate ladder, and at the junior end they want to invest heavily in a class of Software Developer in Tests who will be well trained and highly technically competent. This company is committed to building a world-class Software Developer in Test team!! WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR? This company hires on behaviours and not skills, so rather than look for the finished article, they are looking to hire Test Analysts with 1 to 3 years experience who: - have a computer science, or numerate degree (Physics, Biochem, Maths, etc) - have some level of experience writing code - have chosen a career in testing and QA - have a track record of pushing themselves to excel at the things they are passionate about Any experience with Test Automation tools like Selenium, QTP, TDD, Unit testing, Jenkins or API driven testing would be desirable although not essential. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO YOU? - This Academy will be the first step on a challenging and rewarding career path - The SDiT job title is a new job role for which demand will increase exponentially over the coming years - This is an opportunity to receive a solid investment in your career development, in both a formal and informal setting - Working for a prestigious FTSE100 company - A chance to go through a learning process with a group of like-minded peers, supporting and learning from each other along the way - A way to train and be paid at the same time - Work on a series of technology challenges that simply cannot be found elsewhere: - The volumes of a telco but with a variety of new, greenfield pieces of work - Pace of a start-up but work for a highly profitable and well organised company - Complexity of the challenges at a bank but without the stuffy environment - The relaxed, flexible environment of the media sector, but working on cutting edge technologies on ground breaking systems - Working for a company that is fun to work for</ns1:description>

The right software test analyst will ideally have some experience of SharePoint, either a knowledge of it, or ideally actual experience testing SharePoint systems. Currently the systems are all tested manually, but they are looking at branching out into automation testing tools, so experience within this area would be ideal. 60-70% of the time would be spent testing the SharePoint systems that are being developed by their in house team, while the rest of the team will be spent testing various other financial applications which are currently going a major operating system upgrade. Key Skills needed: - Test Analyst experience working on software applications - SharePoint knowledge - An excellent team work ethic, offering ideas, suggestions and ways forward Ideally they are looking for: - Direct SharePoint testing experience - Automation testing experience (don&apos;t mind what) - Team Foundation Server experience The contract is likely to go on much further than the initial 3 months with plenty of other work around. They are looking to pay around ?240 to ?260/day for the right test analyst. If this is of interest to you, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me, Tom Nevill, at Real IT, as soon as possible for immediate consideration.
