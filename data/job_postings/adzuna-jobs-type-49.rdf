<ns2:requiresSkill rdf:resource="http://www.edsa-project.eu/skill/chef"/>
<ns1:description>Moving to Brighton is a very very good idea. The reasons are endless; I will list some key reasons: Brighton is cheaper then London You don&apos;t need to go on a tube as you could usually walk everywhere. Brightonians are very friendly. Brighton is really trendy and not that boring. Brighton is lovely in the summer; you can go swimming in the sea! Much better air to breath. Now that we talked about the reasons why you should move to Brighton, let&apos;s discuss this sous chef position. A reputable London restaurant group who have smashed the Soho restaurant scene with their casual Mediterranean dining has decided to do the same thing in Brighton and are looking for a sous chef. Considered one of London&apos;s top 100 restaurants there is no doubt the new opening in Brighton will be a hit. Here it is about family, so the sous chef must be a team player and ambitious. The sous chef salary is up to 26k.

<ns1:description>Our Client is looking for an experienced and qualified mechanical services draughtsman for an immediate start. A good design and site (i.e real world experience, not theoretical) knowledge is required but design qualifications are not essential. Our ideal candidate would have at least 2 years recent experience working for a mechanical services contractor in the commercial/industrial sector who has trained as a design draughtsman and is used to producing ductwork installation drawings for site and manufacture drawings compliant with DW144 standards. The candidate will have qualifications in 2D AutoCAD as a minimum but will need to demonstrate that they are more than just a CAD operator by providing evidence/references of actual mechanical services draughting skills. MEP Revit and BIM knowledge would be an advantage but not essential. They will also need to be punctual, dedicated to achieving targets under pressure and be willing to put in additional hours (within reason) as required for the achievement of deadlines imposed by our Clients from time to time. Dynamic is not a word I particularly like but it may best describe the traits necessary to succeed in a contracting environment.  Please email a copy of your cv to Contact: Kelvin Pinard Reference: Totaljobs/193118 Job ID: 63994915</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Lead Front End Technologist - Award Winning FinTech - ?80K + Shares My customer are one of London darling of tech scene who come out flying from the original Google Tech Stars Accelerator Program winning multiple awards along the way. They are quietly turning their revolutionary prototype into a robust, scalable cross-platform mobile application and are looking for a Lead Front End Technologist / Developer / Engineer to come on board and bridge the gap between innovation at design stage and effective and high-performance work in development. Is say technologist for a good reason… This is a team of exceptionally bright and passionate mid/senior engineers and designers that are innovating on a platform to solve real world&apos;s problems that affect us all. This is not your straight forward development role and would suit someone who loves what they do and wants to lead a team of other that do as well. Right now there is an overall technical project lead who manages the whole stack however he is from an extensive Python background and simply does not have the time or the experience to technically lead the Front End and Design teams as they scale to ensure that they are innovating but also that the product they are creating is robust and scalable. Built on Backbone with bespoke OO JavaScript web components on top it is not about expert in the framework here, it is about a deep knowledge of the language and the ability, passion an desire to solve complex problems with Front End technology. With that in mind, for the role we are looking for: Passion and care in every line of code you write Deep knowledge of OO Javascript, MVC Architecture and leading enterprise SPA projects on the front end A keen eye for design and ability to spot issue before they get to production Familiar in a True Agile and true DevOps team Broad depth of knowledge across the front end with Mobile/responsive experience an absolute must But that&apos;s it! This all sound like a big sell but anyone who actually loves what they do and enjoys open collaboration and innovation in a highly skilled team will love this place. In my mind it is a playground for someone at the right level and with the right beliefs and motivations. I am hoping to speak to as many people as possible for this as it goes way beyond technology itself.

<ns1:description>Growing company based in Colindale (but relocating to Kings Langley Hertfordshire by the end of 2015), require an IT professional to support their expanding client base. Initially you will be learning the product from a helpdesk perspective - answering telephone calls and managing hardware and software issues. Once product knowledge is gained, the role will develop into some on-site support and possibly overseas site visits for the right candidate. This role will suit someone with a strong IT focus and exceptional interpersonal skills - the ability to deal with a broad range of customers with differing knowledge levels is essential. An understanding and practical experience of networking, routers and hardware installations, windows support etc is essential. Ideally, you will live within a reasonable commute of Kings Langley and be able to commute to NW9 in the meantime, hold a current and clean drivers license and be immaculate in your presentation. This is an urgent vacancy but unfortunately we can only respond to shortlisted applicants.</ns1:description>
