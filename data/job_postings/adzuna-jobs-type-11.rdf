They have gone from 17 employees to 70 in just three years and it shows no sign of slowing as they continue to add to the team especially as they&apos;ve had significant investment from a well known company in America. Your responsibility will be as the senior technical person in this team taking the lead on key projects, You&apos;ll be working on end-to-end on full project lifecycle : scoping and sizing, analysis, design and modelling, build, test &amp; deployment as well as managing the assigned technical team. Your time will be pent ~50/50 coding/managing. You&apos;ll be supporting the Technical Project Manager with project planning and control. So there is still a big hands on aspect to the position, they have high technical standards which means everyone in the business is of a high level making it a great place to be, there&apos;s an open plan office with a good atmosphere where ideas are thrown around and people bounce of each others energy. You need to be well versed in the development of cubes using MDX and SSAS. You also need to have experience developing ETL solutions using SSIS. You need to be a good communicator and comfortable doing business analysis working directly with stakeholders. This is a client facing position so experience of that is crucial, they have many clients in Europe so you will go out to meet them every so often (only 2 days at a time) and they&apos;ll often come to the office. You also need experience of line management duties for staff and assigning them projects and making sure they perform. This is a superb opportunity to come in to a business that has really taken off in the last few years and put your own stamp on their future success. You won&apos;t be a small cog in a big machine but rather someone who can really have a say and an input in to the way they work. They&apos;re a really nice bunch of people and very social so it&apos;s a great place to be with a pleasant atmosphere.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Development Manager role with an award-winning firm to deliver a range of complex web-based .NET systems. An internal promotion means we&apos;re looking for a hands-off-the-keyboard strong people manager to lead a team of around a dozen .NET Software Developers. You may currently be Senior Developer looking to move away from the keyboard, or a proven Manager / Development Team Lead. This Development Manager role won&apos;t involve coding at all though it&apos;s essential for you to have progressed your career from Developer. The emphasis is very much on people management (work allocation, scheduling, planning, objective setting, etc.) as opposed to technical management. However, ultimate responsibility for the quality of code being produced will be yours. These are incredibly busy times so we need this Development Manager to be well-versed in the art of management - you&apos;ll have the battle scars to prove it! It&apos;s a highly pragmatic .NET development environment which is very much business-driven. This Development Manager must bring technical credibility with the .NET Framework and past in-depth skills with either C# or VB.NET and strong SQL database skills. Your team will be developing complex, multi-tier, web applications. As Development Manager you&apos;ll develop relationships within a wider group development function, including Testing, Release and Support teams. It&apos;s a fantastic time for a proven software engineer to join - there is a large pipeline of work and opportunity for you to hone your skills. You will have peers within the business and plenty of people to bounce ideas off. This firm are well-positioned off the M6 in North Staffordshire so commutable within 45 minutes from the likes of Crewe, Stoke, Macclesfield, Northwich, Congleton, Burton, Derby, Cannock, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Telford. We can offer ?70k plus car and bonus as benefits. Please apply for this Development Manager role to neileshsood @ computerpeople.co.uk or 01159485712.

<ns1:jobTitle>Recruitment Consultant Commercial Recruitment</ns1:jobTitle>
<ns1:description>Recruitment Consultant – Commercial / Office Services – Established Desk Sheffield  Basic to 30k + top industry commission My clients are a UK wide market leader within their field and due to two up coming maternity leavers they are looking to recruit two experienced commercial recruitment consultants. These roles are not contract based and will be offered as permanent positions. They are able to do this as it fits with the overall growth plans of the team for 2015. Both of these desks are very successful and while some of the workload will be distributed amongst the existing team a portion of the work will remain on each desk to give a truly warm start to both new recruits. To put that in context there would be in the region of 4-5k over a 4 week month for each consultant to come in to. So it is completely accurate to describe both desks as warm with an element of account management. However, on the flip side consultants must also be completely engaged with the prospect of business development. ?4-5k a month is to give the successful candidates a start and make the transition into a new company easier for them if they are walking away from a warm desk. The expectation is though that they must build their own business on top of this. That would be expected anyway in terms of hitting the required performance level, but at the end of the maternity period, these original clients will be handed back to the returning consultant. For the following 3 months though, the revenue will be split 50/50 between the returner and this consultant. Thereafter it will be 100% with the returner. So in short, immediate business to benefit from and look after in terms of personal earnings, an expectation of growth from this foundation which will ultimately become the core of their desk, 50% earning benefit from the ‘foundation’ business for 3 months when handed back.  For a confidential chat about the above roles apply here or contact Donna Turner at Code Blue Recruitment on LinkedIn.

<ns1:description>Position:           QA Engineer Location:         Southampton Salary:              ?30K - ?35K Job purpose     To oversee, monitor, maintain and improve the technical quality of software and systems produced by the technical team(s). Principal objectives       This role splits into three key areas: general technical responsibilities, role-specific responsibilities and personal objectives. General technical responsibilities: To be an integrated and effective member of the technical team, being able to help and support others, as well as suggesting new/improved technologies and methodologies as appropriate. Act as a technical contact to provide support to the research team, and relate technical concepts clearly and effectively. To learn and exhibit in depth knowledge of relevant components of the systems and their application to business needs. To plan ones’ own time and communicate proactively (both verbally and in writing) so that agreed deadlines are met and stakeholder expectations are managed. To capitalise on ones’ growing experience to ensure that tasks are being completed as efficiently as possible. Role-specific responsibilities: Generally, to manage and maintain the technical quality of systems.  Technical quality means bug rates, security issues, and robustness. Maintain and develop the testing infrastructure (including unit tests). Implement and maintain tests. Review existing code and update for current coding conventions and correctness. Review new code submissions across the team for quality; liaising with developers, identifying and fixing issues and improving overall quality and robustness as appropriate. Continuously review development practises, conventions, guidelines, procedures and rules – proposing and implementing improvements where necessary to improve technical quality. Evangelise quality, testing and effective development practises to the team. Personal objectives: Personal objectives are designed to stretch the job holder in order to facilitate career progression or to target an area for specific improvement. They are mutually agreed in each review. Planning and organising  The job holder must be able to self-manage and enthusiastically “own” their tasks with effective communication of their progress to stakeholders and on-going support of their features. We expect the job holder to be able to effectively focus on one task at a time and to accurately estimate timelines, factoring in appropriate contingency time. Decisions  The job holder will be given the chance to provide input into the technologies and tools that they will use to achieve the job roles. The job holder will be given the freedom to decide the technical design underpinning a task that they have been given as long as it sits within the Company’s overall design goals. Contact with others       The job holder will have significant contact with all members of the team, however most contact will be with other members of the technical team. Contact within the technical team will be day-to-day to facilitate support, sharing of best practises and peer code review. Contact with the research team will be required to fully understand requirements, to provide on-going support for the engineers’ own components, and to evangelise quality and testing. Occasionally the job holder may be required to liaise with clients via email, phone or in person when accompanied by a senior staff member in order to gain a deeper understanding of requirements and issues. Greatest challenge         To adopt the “strategic approach” when choosing an implementation plan so developments are always made in a generic, and therefore reusable, way. Knowledge/Skills/Experience    At least 3 years commercial experience in a similar role. Ability to accurately estimate timescales. Ability to abstract away from detail, keeping developed solutions as generic as possible. Strong attention to detail, and an investigatory and methodical approach. Experience in developing using PHP5 or later. Adept at Object Oriented programming methodologies. Some experience with PostgreSQL DBMS is advantageous. Experience with PHPUnit, Selenium and similar testing platforms is advantageous. Contact: Joanne Senior Reference: Totaljobs/226554 Job ID: 63871620</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>A Computer Science graduate is sought by this exciting 25 person company to join their web development team and build a suite of Java and Groovy web applications. This is a small company with a flat management structure, that provides financial software to assist small and medium sized companies to manage their business. Their revenue is entirely driven by the technology and consistent financial success now means they are investing growing their web development team. Importantly, as a small company this means that they can offer a graduate a rare opportunity to actually start building software from a very early stage. They are too small to take on developers and do nothing except just train them for a year, so this is an opportunity to come in and be listened to during design sessions, take genuine responsibility to deliver components during sprints and work with other stakeholders across the rest of the business. This is a role with training, with investment in your career, with responsibility and a chance to be a big part of a small business at a key stage of its development. THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS ROLE This web team uses a mix of a Grails and Spring framework developing Java and Groovy components. They are lead by a technical management team - who work as developers in this flat team structure - have chosen a set of cutting edge web technologies to deliver their software, including Puppet, Gradle, Git and Grails. They use groovy because of its quick code generation, its dynamic properties and easy testing/mocking. This team works in a Scrum and BDD methodology. They have 2 weekly sprints and divvy up the work using stories in Scrum meetings. During the meetings each story is discussed and developers gather initial requirements. Then each developer takes complete ownership / responsibility for taking a story through to competition. Each story could be anything from an application feature, to a component to a fully blown application. As a full stack development position this role could involve anything from a UI design and mock-up, to writing database scripts and entities, to writing both front end and back end Java or Groovy code. This is a genuine end-to-end, full stack, full Software Development Life Cycle development position, working within a fast changing environment, on development for multiple clients, who in the main are FTSE100 companies, or other global brands. It will involve looking at architecture, build environments and how you deploy software. WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR They are looking for a graduate with a degree in Computer Science or something similar (Software Engineering etc) who has some experience of Java and of building web applications, and is keen to get on and build software. WHY THIS IS SUCH A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY - Many grad schemes a big companies involve formal training schemes and being moved around the company, often to other geographical locations, and after 2 years you might not have built any software at all. - The scale of the responsibility that is on offer to a graduate will be hard to find elsewhere. - At this company, with its flat management structure, means that there is room to be creative. If you see an opportunity or feature, or something that you think can be improved or automated, you can make suggestions and if they are any good you&apos;ll be given the go ahead to implement your vision.</ns1:description>
