<ns1:description>7digital aims to simplify access to the world’s music and radio. Our robust, scalable digital music platform and flexible APIs are used to power comprehensive music and radio services for leading consumer brands, mobile carriers, broadcasters, automotive systems, retailers, record labels, artists and agencies. Alongside proven technology, we offer global music rights, award-winning radio production services, and content management expertise, making us a leading global partner in this space. Right now we are engaged in a number of very exciting wearable projects for will.i.am (we&apos;re the music on his Puls watch), hi-res audio services for Onkyo and Meridian, along with developing streaming products for ROK Mobile and Guvera. About this job: We need an experienced Web Operations / Systems Engineer with a high level knowledge in servers, Cisco networking, operating systems and ideally operating services in the cloud who is keen to work on a high availability and high demand system – in a collaborative manner – building a robust, resilient and automated platform which can cope with scaling up to meet an ever increasing demand: Our infrastructure is handling around 500 requests per second (and growing). Half the organisation is made up of tech people (Systems, Developers, DBAs, QAs), and the other half is actually a pretty friendly bunch and nice to work with! We’re massive fans of the DevOps movement, we organise regular events in the office and aim to keep the right focus in a fast moving industry with a very agile development team. We&apos;re running ~70% Linux but also have some Windows (for the moment anyway) – we’re pretty technology agnostic. The work opportunities are broad: We manage most of our own hardware and network and we have a lot of it (500-ish units). We run our own virtualised environments. We&apos;ve been going automation crazy (with tests and everything). It&apos;s making us happier and more productive. We’re making greater use of IaaS &amp; PaaS such as Amazon AWS. We are currently moving our data centre to cloud over the next 6 months to move to cloud data services using AWS containerised in Docker on Linux. We have many sophisticated products and applications and are making better use of technologies like Nginx, HAProxy and Varnish within them (rather than coding our way out of every challenge). Day-to-day, this job will involve Working in a highly collaborative manner with everyone in the organisation, particularly our other technical staff. Improving the way we collaborate and get things done. Making occasional visits to our data centres to do things we can’t do remotely. About you (take your pick, the more the better): You have a proven track record in a Systems Administration/Server Engineer role. You&apos;ve worked in a product driven environment. You are aware of DevOps, what it means and want to work in an environment where the collaboration and team interactions make this happen. You know the importance of monitoring and have experience configuring and managing monitoring tools. You have hands on experience with server build automation. You&apos;re experienced with configuring network devices and routing. You&apos;ve experience with handling a lot of storage (think Petabytes) You love Linux, but you don’t think Windows inherently is evil. You have experience with database/search infrastructure. You’re experienced with maintaining high availability and high demand systems. You care about you being better, your team being better and your company being better. You enjoy working with other people outside of IT operations. Technologies: You don’t need to know them all, but if you have experience with many of these, things are looking promising. OS: Debian Linux, Windows Server 2008R2/2012 Web servers, proxies and Caches: Nginx, IIS, Varnish, HAProxy Automation: We use Chef &amp; some CFEngine (+ other things). Hardware: Dell, Cisco, Juniper Cloud computing: Amazon AWS, Azure Monitoring: Zabbix, New Relic, Logstash, Kibana, Graphite, StatsD Source Control: Git, Subversion CI/CD: Jenkins, TeamCity Database/document stores: SQL Server, Mongodb, elasticsearch, Solr Storage: GlusterFS Other important tech: Debian Package Management, KVM, ASP.NET, PowerDNS, RackTables Other tech you might run into, but not daily: Apache, Exim, SFTP, ProFTPd, MySQL, Samba To apply for this positon please submit your CV online.

<ns1:description>This is an exciting and fast moving time for the UK energy industry. ElectraLink is positioned at the centre of this developing industry interfacing directly with the key UK energy stakeholders such as energy suppliers, distributors and metering organisations as well as the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and Ofgem (the industry regulator). The utility markets are increasingly competitive and constantly evolving, requiring significant interaction between industry parties, regulators, policy makers and increasingly consumers. To make these interactions work, agreements and codes need to be in place. These are the industry &quot;rule books&quot;, which are there to ensure that markets work efficiently and all parties have access to a level playing field. We lead the market in establishing and operating these Governance arrangements. A central challenge within Governance is that as the market evolves and changes, so must the codes and agreements. This process of change itself needs to be managed in a structured, transparent and cost-effective way that is fair to everyone. The Governance team at ElectraLink provide code administration services to three energy industry codes by supporting the panels and committees that run the codes and the customers that sign up to them. The scope of all the codes, and ElectraLink’s support of them, has expanded since their introduction and this is set to continue. To support the continued growth in this area we have a new vacancy within our Governance team which will play a key role in managing changes to these codes and providing administration support to the team.

<ns1:description>Web Developer - MVC Angular Canterbury VR/01570R Competitive Market Rate Is this you? You are a natural problem solver, you are always looking for a solution. Someone tells you how they want an application to change; and you’re instantly thinking about how it will work, what the challenges will be and how you will overcome them. You innovate in everything you do. You strive to deliver quality constantly assessing the best methods and anticipating a user’s needs. Sometimes you can solve a problem without writing a line of code. Sometime you can just reference a library to get what you need, but you also know when we should write something from scratch. You should be passionate about code. Interested in how it works, what you can achieve with it, where it is going. You will understand how software ideas become a reality, what it takes to achieve this and what the boundaries are. Why sometimes we don’t achieve this, what a bug is, why do they happen and how to minimise them. You can mentor, train, explain and report on information clearly and concisely. And you can do this on all levels inside and outside a business. You should be able to prove these statements with explanations of contribution to past projects. If this is you then would you like to be building? A generic web framework with over 10 years of evolved code and features. We are a software house providing a vast number of applications and this framework is key to the success of a selection of these. You will be working on the whole stack of code from the database to the UI. At all levels the code will be reusable, scalable and performant. You will be creating generic flexible features other technical and non-technical user will use, some of which will be outside of the company. Design will also be as important as functionality. You will be refactoring older code and writing new code in a variety of languages. All of which you will be doing to internal standards and bringing your industry knowledge with you. If you still think this is for you here’s how we will facilitate you:- If you are the successful candidate would be working for a Times Top 100 employer. You will contribute to planning meetings listening to other opinions and contributing your own. Here you may need to back up your ideas, designs and estimates with clear evidence and sound arguments. These arguments should take in all aspects of software development including architecture, maintainability, readability and usability. You will also contribute to daily SCRUM meetings where you keep the whole team up to date with progress but more importantly risk. Not just with you own work but any risk you may identify. You will need to present you work in review meeting, sometimes containing multiple directors and other stakeholders. They will need concise planned presentation and you will need to answer any technical question clearly and quickly. What we need for you:- You will need to understand how a website works. This should include a thorough understanding of everything from the server through the transport layer and on the client. You will need to be able to use css, html and javascript to achieve any task in a website autonomously. You will need to be able to use Visual Studio with version control to code locally and contribute to a central code base.

They don&apos;t expect you to know Scala, but you will be excited to learn it if you don&apos;t know it already. You should have mastered at least one compiled object-orientated language, have worked on at least one big software project, and feel comfortable working autonomously on designing/building large scale maintainable and testable systems. The successful candidate will be able to write structured, testable code for their web applications. You should have experience of object-oriented programming in Scala, Java and also some practical experience of building and maintaining commercial applications. If you can show code from Github, that is always a plus. An excellent salary and benefits package is on offer, with interviews available immediately.  Essential skills: Scala, Java, MySQL, Linux, PHP, Python.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>C++ contract - Banking - London - ?550-650 I am currently searching for 3 C++ contractors to work for one of my investment banking clients based in central London. In this role you will be working a new Greenfield pricing and risk system that is used across the bank. You will need to have strong experience of developing highly complex multi-threaded application in a mission critical environment. You will need very strong knowledge of C++ and ideally some C# experience would be great. UNIX is the main OS. Solid object oriented principles and highly fault tolerant system development exposure. Also you will need to be used to dealing with large scale library&apos;s written mainly in C++ but some in Java. As with the majority of financial market data Strong experience in networks and heavy IO based systems would be a huge plus for this role. As this is a Greenfield project you should be confident in proposing new design and architecture ideas along with strong emphasis on best coding practice and clean / efficient code. Ideally you will have banking experience but if you are a strong developer and want to get into banking that will be considered. Skills needed Strong C++ and some C# Unix and Windows XML OO design and architecture experience This project is set to last 3 years so there is potential for a long term contract. If you feel this is a role that you will be interested in then please do send your CV to Lloyd Axten at Energon People for an immediate response.</ns1:description>
