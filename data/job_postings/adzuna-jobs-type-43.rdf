<ns1:description>Design Engineer Salary c?40-45k depending on experience. A client based in the East of Manchester who design and develop complex technically innovative products for the defence markets are looking to recruit a talented electronics engineer to the team with some knowledge of embedded software. A crude estimate would be a split of 70/80% electronics and 20/30% software. If interested please contact Andrew Knight of Amrec Recruitment Ltd. 3 years industrial design experience minimum. Degree or equivalent to have covered the following subjects: Computing Electronics (analogue and digital) Mathematics/mathematics in computing Microprocessor-based equipment Programming and programming languages Logic and FPGA design PCB design (Altium Designer, ideally) This candidate will require a Microprocessor and PIC electronics design, build, test and programming background, ideally with a hobby interest as well as a professional interest. Familiarity with PC-based systems, PCs and LANs using G-bit Ethernet and design of simulation systems will be required. An extensive and practical C programming knowledge for embedded systems is mandatory. C++ and Visual C also essential. Electronics design experience of systems or products incorporating the following is also essential: FPGAs, 8, 32 and 64-bit microcontrollers, serial communications especially RS-422, RS-232 and CANbus, and digital and analogue circuitry, e.g. DVI, LVDS, SDI and composite video. In writing software, a clear and considered quality control approach, with impeccable commenting and consideration of configuration control is required. Log sheets of intermediate software changes will need to be kept. The candidate may occasionally be present at discussions with customers and help devise specifications for functionality of user interfaces for display systems, normally used within platforms such as military vehicles. Subsequently, and to agreed timescales, the candidate will write an HMI that rigorously embodies the agreed specification, produce emulators that reproduce parts of the system not available to exercise the written HMI, and perform tests that demonstrate correct performance. Understanding and use of text and graphics, familiarity with video systems and video processing will be a considerable advantage. Hardware design and build capability will be required. This requires knowledge of analogue electronics and microprocessor based architectures to circuit diagram and component level. Ability to design high-speed multilayer PCBs incorporating EMC techniques, impedancematched and delay-controlled tracking, surface mount components and some power componentry is therefore essential. The candidate will need to be security cleared by UK MoD and US DoD. Contact: Andrew Knight Reference: Totaljobs/04849896 Job ID: 64062353</ns1:description>

<ns1:jobTitle>Support Worker</ns1:jobTitle>
<ns1:description>At Turning Point, we support people across the UK with substance misuse problems. As a Support Worker, you&apos;ll make a real difference to their lives as you provide support and advice to help each and every one of our service users achieve their potential. If you&apos;re passionate about getting in to this field of work, then this role is a great way to further your knowledge or to get a better understanding of this client group and how to work effectively with them. As one of our Support Workers, you&apos;ll be 100% committed to making sure that people with substance misuse problems have the best support to address their addiction both, on a one to one basis and also as part of the group work we offer. This is a hands-on role and you will be expected to provide administration support to the programs team, as well as being an integral part of assisting in the delivery of daily programs. You will initially support the programs team, however your duties will vary and you will be supporting Recovery Workers to perform a wide range of day-to-day activities as and when this is required. At a practical level, you will need good IT and communication skills which are an essential part of your everyday role, both in addressing the client group, colleagues and other partnership agencies. Although previous relevant experience, on either a voluntary basis or as a paid employee is preferable, most important is that you&apos;re flexible, patient, can show empathy and are able to view situations from a service user&apos;s perspective. Working in this environment and alongside the client group at times can be difficult and challenging, so you will need to be non-judgemental, with a sensitive approach and a good understanding of how to meet complex needs related to substance misuse.</ns1:description>
