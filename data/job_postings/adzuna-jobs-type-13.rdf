<ns1:description>A Java technical lead is sought by this globally renowned eCommerce web platform to lead a new team they are creating and deliver a new component stream that will capitalise on their Java-based ultra high volume of web hits and provide them with a new suite of products. This household name web platform generates an enormous amount of unique visitors a day, and their core transaction engine handles something in the region of 3 billion calls a day. Therefore the Java technical lead they are looking to hire must have experience in working on high volume, low latency applications. Handling the funnel is no mean feat, so experience with distributed systems, grid computing, CAP theorem (AKA Brewer&apos;s Theorem) and concurrency are key requirements for this position that will involve leading a team of 6 developers. This global company, with a FTSE250 listing, values technologists that are hands on at a senior level. What they are looking for is someone who is a heavy hitting Java developer, who wants to continue being hands on but also face off to senior management, have responsibility for design and architecture, have technical ownership - and responsibility - for a specific component stream, and coaching and mentoring juniors.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Could I interest you in this role? Immediate start isavailable. This role is temporary for 13 weeks after which if both sides agree you will become a permanent member of staff. If you are there after 13 weeks they will offer youa permanent position and the salary and bonus will exceed that offered below. The atmosphere is great my staff on site love it and it is not a telesales operation you are not closing sales. It’s a 2 minute walk from the Oracle and has 100+ staff so plenty of promotional opportunities once you prove yourself. Current Needs Shift is M-T 7.30 - 4.30 Friday 7.45 to 3.15 Telemarketers make up the majority of our employees and are key to the success of our client assignments - the quality and volume of the work delivered by Telemarketers is what makes us highly regarded and brings a high level of repeat business, and new clients through our reputation. Role: German speaking Telemarketer/Lead Generator Location: Reading Salary ?10/11.00ph + Bonus ?1.50 p.h(Umbrella* increases by a further ?1.00 - ?13.50per hour) * I will explain The role is based in Reading. You will spend much of your day on the phone - making outbound calls to generate leads for our blue chip clients in the technology sector. We contact mid to senior level professionals on behalf of our clients and so a professional and skilled approach is essential at all times. You will also need to be self-motivated and positive. Teams work on the same campaign and such campaigns vary regularly. The role also requires you to be organised and efficient and able to write well - leads have to be written up clearly and quickly onto our computer systems, so you must have reasonably competent keyboard skills. The role includes a structured development programme designed to enhance your call skills and campaign performance as well as giving you options to sign up to an accredited Apprenticeship Programme. In addition there is the training for potential development to a Team Leader role in 15 months from starting with the business. We are also keen to make sure that we are continuously improving - we are open to ideas from everyone in the organisation, as long as they are well thought through and articulated clearly. Many of our campaigns are conducted in a language other than English - and in different time zones around the world - occasionally shift working is required to meet the demands of these campaigns, although it is on a voluntary basis. Overnight working attracts additional pay.</ns1:description>
