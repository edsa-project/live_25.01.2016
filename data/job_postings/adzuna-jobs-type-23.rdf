<ns1:description>Software Test/Verification Technician -2 month contract- ?9-?11 p/h Available to start 2nd November Ou client has a requirement for a Software Test/Verification Technician to assist with the verification of embedded software within a Point of Care (POC) instrument used in the monitoring of the A1C level of diabetic patients. The embedded software is in the process of being updated and test specifications/protocols generated, each aligning with each of the requirement specifications. The software update is principally associated with the addition of &apos;connectivity’ features enabling the instrument to communicate with a Data Management System over a hospital network and as such it is not envisaged that the work will involve running assays. The work will involve running the test specifications / protocols in turn, checking the instrument response against the expected outcome and documenting said outcome on pre-prepared test sheets. It will be a great opportunity for a recent graduate in an engineering or scientific discipline to gain a couple of months of work experience. Training will be given though it is expected that successful candidate(s) will be able to pick up new ideas, learn quickly and particularly pay attention to detail as this data will be used in support of future regulatory submissions. Responsibilities: Conduct instrument software test and verification activities in the R&amp;D Test Laboratory in accordance with company procedures and the detailed test specifications. Document test and verification activities. Ensure that the test / verification schedule meets the required timelines or flag where this is likely to deviate. Desirable Knowledge and Expertise: Familiar with using laboratory hardware either from past A level or degree studies. Computer literate e.g. Excel/Word. Personal Characteristics: Team worker, but equally able to work on their own Self-motivated/self-starter Organised Good communication skills (ask if don’t understand) Excellent attention to detail</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Summary Based in Horsham, West Sussex this is a great opportunity for an ambitious individual looking to progress their career within clinical trials. This role is designed to offer an experienced clinical trial professional who understand processes procedures and clinical significance to develop a new career in Clinical Trial Supply Chain Management. Supply chains play a highly critical part of overall studies and are becoming more complex as specialist, high value drugs requiring managed packaging and distribution (such as cold chain goods) are increasingly being tested. It is a fact that the expenditure on managing supply chains for most phase 3 studies exceeds the expenditure on running the investigational sites. If you have worked as a Clinical Trial Administrator, Clinical Research Associate, Data Management, IVRS Project Coordination or other role with broad clinical trial exposure this could be the opportunity you have been looking for.   The Company For over 20 years our client has focused on serving the packaging, labelling and distribution requirements of clinical trials across the world. As clinical trials require increasingly complex supply chain support, the organisations integrated solutions provide the global presence and flexibility to integrate into clients own operational and quality processes. Our client is the market leader in CTS solutions with operations in the US, UK, Switzerland and Singapore that are backed by a global distribution infrastructure.  The Role Based on your clinical trial expertise this role is to join the Clinical Supply Chain Management Team as an Associate Clinical Supply Chain Manager. The role focuses on supporting external clients and internal Clinical Supply Chain Managers in translating clinical needs into packaging, labelling, distribution and IRT /IVRS strategies. This includes the interpretation of clinical protocols and client’s operating procedures that will be successfully interpreted into robust supply chain plans. Working with, and in support of, key stakeholders ultimately you will assist in developing processes and procedures ensuring clinical IMP availability which will be achieved by accurate forecasting, scheduling, operational coordination and risk management. You will have the ability to work with cross-functional teams for study management activities and to ensure regulatory compliance. Internal contacts will include Project Management colleagues while externally they will include CROs, IVR/IWR providers, client clinical supply teams and client clinical operations teams.  This is a very fast-paced role that requires excellent communication skills and the ability to work with initiative under pressure.      Benefits - Highly competitive salary to ?35,000 - Full training in Clinical Trial Supply Chains based on clinical trial expertise - Structured career path  - Contributory pension scheme - Bonus scheme - Private health cover - Full home office support Experience The successful candidate will have a full understanding of clinical trial processes, procedures, clinical significance and regulatory standards. You could have gained your expertise working as a Clinical Trial Administrator, Clinical Trial Coordinator, Clinical Research Associate, Data Management, IVRS Project Coordination, Clinical Supplies or other role with broad clinical trial exposure. This experience could have been gained in either a pharmaceutical / sponsor or service provider environment.    Please note this is NOT a graduate trainee opportunity as we require clinical trial experience gained in a commercial workplace environment.
