<ns1:description>The Role My client provide a software product that allows organisations to deploy enterprise applications to mobile devices with a genuine mobile first UI. Because each of our customers have configured their enterprise applications to their precise requirements, we have built product in a very flexible way so it can be very quickly configured to support the configured back-end application and the end user&apos;s process. The Clinet is built using the latest technology and is a highly innovative way of deploying transactional business processes onto mobile devices. Our early adopters have been successful with the product and we believe that there is a great future for the product in an expanding range of sub-markets. We now wish to add a highly skilled developer to our small but focused Software product development team. We put a great deal of emphasis on well-structured and re-usable code. The expectation is that on joining the developer would immediately start contributing to our development efforts whilst learning and understanding our code base. He / she ought to be able to intuitively implement good coding practice, and quickly start contributing to the design of specific areas of the application including &quot;green field&quot; build. Today, this is very much a &quot;hands on&quot; position but, over time, the ideal candidate will develop to the point where they can mentor other people. We are a small organisation and the successful candidate can expect to interact with our sales and consulting organisations, and customers. Consequently, in addition to pure development, the role might include things such as: assisting in the creation of demo configurations to showcase the product&apos;s capabilities supporting the product in live usage building PoCs of new application areas / product capabilities for specific sales prospects and customers In other words, this is an opportunity to be involved in the complete product lifecycle through design, build and customer implementation. Experience Level We imagine that this opportunity will probably be right for someone with 2 to 4 years very high quality post-graduation experience. It is, however, possible that an exceptional candidate with less post-graduation experience might be the right person. Essential Requirements Academic a 2:1 or better in a numerate discipline from a reputable institution (or equivalent if you studied outside of the UK). It is not necessary to have a Computer Science degree - we are just as interested to hear from candidates with other numerate degrees such as Maths, Physics and Engineering. All of our technical staff have at least a Bachelors degree, some have progressed to a Masters degree and a few have a Doctorate 3 A levels at grade A or B in serious subjects (or equivalent if you studied outside of the UK) Personal Enthusiasm, determination and a sense of &quot;mission&quot; The articulacy to discuss complex technical concepts with peers and management Technical Heavyweight development experience in Object Oriented languages, and especially with experience in designing class models involving a high degree of abstraction. It is highly preferable if that experience is in the context of a transactional business application. C# / Java HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript Please note that no amount of experience will act as a substitute for genuine technical ability and flair Nice to Have Requirements Any of the following would be a bonus, but don&apos;t outweigh the critical importance of the Essential Requirements Experience with JavaScript frameworks such as Knockout Experience of building a standard product that can be deployed in many scenarios as opposed to a custom application</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>QA Engineers with 1 to 3 years experience (manual or automation) are sought by this technology-driven FTSE100 company to join their Development team as a Software Development Engineer In Test and take part in a 6 month on-the-job-training period where they will be taught to program in Java. This position is a permanent position from day one, but the training will be a well funded, structured training session for a period of 6 months where technologists who have a passion for QA and automating as much of the test process as possible will be trained to become a Software Development Engineer In Test who uses Java to build software that tests software. WHAT IS A &quot;SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER IN TEST&quot;? &quot;A Software Development Engineer In Test … is a QA but the focus is on writing automated tests rather than on creating and running manual test cases. Think of it as writing software to test software. It can be a particularly challenging career choice because it takes both programming skill and a good understanding of software testing.&quot; So in summary its: - A QA - who can write Java code - and use that code to write software to test software WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? In many technology-driven company QA ends up being the poor relation to the development team. However at this FTSE100 company they want their SDET career path to be just as prestigious and as enviable as a developer career path. So they have beefed up their own existing SDET team with seniors from Amazon and Google at the higher end of the corporate ladder, and at the junior end they want to invest heavily in a class of Software Development Engineers In Test who will be well trained and highly technically competent. This company is committed to building a world-class Software Development Engineer In Test team!! WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR? This company hires on behaviours and not skills, so rather than look for the finished article, they are looking to hire Test Analysts and QAs with 1 to 3 years experience who: - have a computer science, or numerate degree (Physics, Biochem, Maths, etc) - have some level of experience writing code - have chosen a career in testing and QA - have a track record of pushing themselves to excel at the things they are passionate about what they do Any experience with Test Automation tools like Selenium, QTP, TDD, Unit testing, Jenkins or API driven testing would be desirable although not essential. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO YOU? - This Academy will be the first step on a challenging and rewarding career path - The SDET job title is a new job role for which demand will increase exponentially over the coming years - This is an opportunity to receive a solid investment in your career development, in both a formal and informal setting - Working for a prestigious FTSE100 company - A chance to go through a learning process with a group of like-minded peers, supporting and learning from each other along the way - A way to train and be paid at the same time - Work on a series of technology challenges that simply cannot be found elsewhere: - The volumes of a telco but with a variety of new, greenfield pieces of work - Pace of a start-up but work for a highly profitable and well organised company - Complexity of the challenges at a bank but without the stuffy environment - The relaxed, flexible environment of the media sector, but working on cutting edge technologies on ground breaking systems - Working for a company that is fun to work for</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Test Analysts with 1 to 3 years experience (manual or automation) are sought by this technology-driven FTSE100 company to join a Software Developer In Test Academy Class they are planning to start at the beginning of January. This Academy Class will be a well funded, structured training session for a period of 6 months where technologists who have a passion for QA and automating as much of the test process as possible will be trained to become Software Developers In Test. At the end of the 6 months training this role will be automatically converted into a permanent position, with the job title &quot;Software Developer in Test&quot; WHAT IS A &quot;SOFTWARE DEVELOPER IN TEST&quot;? &quot;A Software Developer in test… is a QA but the focus is on writing automated tests rather than on creating and running manual test cases. Think of it as writing software to test software. It can be a particularly challenging career choice because it takes both programming skill and a good understanding of software testing.&quot; So in summary its: - A QA - who can write Java code - and use that code to write software to test software WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? In many technology-driven company QA ends up being the poor relation to the development team. However at this FTSE100 company they want their SDIT career path to be just as prestigious and as enviable as a developer career path. So they have beefed up their own existing SDiT team with seniors from Amazon and Google at the higher end of the corporate ladder, and at the junior end they want to invest heavily in a class of Software Developer in Tests who will be well trained and highly technically competent. This company is committed to building a world-class Software Developer in Test team!! WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR? This company hires on behaviours and not skills, so rather than look for the finished article, they are looking to hire Test Analysts with 1 to 3 years experience who: - have a computer science, or numerate degree (Physics, Biochem, Maths, etc) - have some level of experience writing code - have chosen a career in testing and QA - have a track record of pushing themselves to excel at the things they are passionate about Any experience with Test Automation tools like Selenium, QTP, TDD, Unit testing, Jenkins or API driven testing would be desirable although not essential. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO YOU? - This Academy will be the first step on a challenging and rewarding career path - The SDiT job title is a new job role for which demand will increase exponentially over the coming years - This is an opportunity to receive a solid investment in your career development, in both a formal and informal setting - Working for a prestigious FTSE100 company - A chance to go through a learning process with a group of like-minded peers, supporting and learning from each other along the way - A way to train and be paid at the same time - Work on a series of technology challenges that simply cannot be found elsewhere: - The volumes of a telco but with a variety of new, greenfield pieces of work - Pace of a start-up but work for a highly profitable and well organised company - Complexity of the challenges at a bank but without the stuffy environment - The relaxed, flexible environment of the media sector, but working on cutting edge technologies on ground breaking systems - Working for a company that is fun to work for</ns1:description>

Please get in touch if you are experienced in any of the above technologies (note - we are not looking for you to have them all). We are interested in speaking to persons of any level from junior candidates to senior experts in their field. Our client offers: Competitive annual salary (above market rate) Medical coverage Discounted hotel accommodation; anywhere in the world Exposure to travel industry Excellent growth opportunities Exciting, multicultural environment Dress code: smart casual We are happy to receive CV from both international &amp; local candidates as we offer relocation assistance and visa sponsorship for eligible candidates.

<ns1:description>My client is looking for people with an outstanding academic record: 1st class degree in maths, physics or engineering, combined with exceptional A-levels (or equivalent). Postgraduate degrees also count in your favour. They tackle some of the most complex and challenging optimisation problems and we need people who can solve them. Most of their team are Oxbridge graduates, and many have PhDs, but equally important to us is common sense. Experience is not essential - what we need is people who can think. Every company says their work is interesting, but my clients really is. Their customers organisations like Pepsi, TNT, B&amp;Q use their systems and have saved millions while reducing their environmental footprint and making their operations more efficient using our software. They design very advanced optimisation algorithms to solve these problems, implement them in a software system and install them for our customers to use. The emphasis is on innovation and creativity, not just writing code for code&apos;s sake. Most of our their clients are UK-based but we also work in Europe and further afield, and our R&amp;D activity involves working with the top universities internationally. This means you are not locked up in a cupboard all day writing code. Their work is a good combination of opportunities to visit interesting places from time to time with a sensible work-life balance.
