The data for the database has been collected and is classified up to Secret. The resource will be required to work with the existing project team to develop the database requirement before delivering. The successful candidate must have extensive knowledge and experience in MS Access and Excel and will be able to demonstrate experience in setting up relational databases to pull separate sets of data together. You will be able to demonstrate experience of form, report and query design within MS Access and know how to link data between Microsoft Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook and Html. Ideally, you will also be: Adept at using Visual Basic for Applications. Proficient in other Microsoft Office applications - MS Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Able to demonstrate strong interpersonal communication skills and be able to communicate with analysts. Able to work under tight deadlines. Able to demonstrate debugging and analytical skills in MS Access.

In this critical role, you will be working as part of the Reward team, where you will be primarily responsible for delivering a first-class service providing timely and accurate data to your colleagues. This will include running and creating reports, collating, formatting and analysing data linked to Reward processes such as annual pay reviews, performance ratings, bonus payments and company benefit schemes. In addition to this, you will take ownership of the configuration and maintenance of our web based Reward systems. This will require you to become an expert user so that you are able to ensure processes are set up and run smoothly, deal with any system queries, assist with new implementations and upgrades and ensure that the systems are user-friendly. You will also contribute to the maintenance and design of the HR section of our Intranet to ensure all published pages are informative and easy to navigate.

<ns1:description>We have an exciting and rare opportunity for an experienced Data Manager to join a very highly thought of Science based organisation located in Newmarket.

The role will carry responsibility for two staff - one is a data inputter/cleanser/specialist, and the other is a PHP programmer creating the back end scripts for this function so an awareness of these areas is important in order to be able to manage them properly..... but there is no need to be able to actually do these roles to any great level or have these skills to any level past a general understanding (maybe it would have been covered in a course, or have been sitting with/in charge of staff carrying out these functions previously - the and the webdevelopment has been outsourced to a third party, therefore awareness of HTML, CSS would also be advantageous but again no need to have actually have this as a primary skill. The day to day activities will include a) managing the supplier data in conjunctino with the programmer and data specialist to ensure that the data is editied to a format that is acceptable for their product database b) providing date from the database that suits the requirements of the website, eprocurement platforms, tenders and other product listings c) sytematically meeting wtih existing and potential eprocurement platform providers to increase their depth and coverage of the clients products d) formulate and manage the data budget requirements annually e) monitor existing eprocurement platforms sales and review their effectiveness f) providing quarterly reports to the board on eprocurement and data g) managing other members of the data team to enable ta streamlined process h) managing the product database to ensre the data quality is optimised to provide the best outputs i) implementing best practice data procedures to ensure data integrity j) troubleshoot data errors k) ensure data for the website will provide customers with all that is requried for them to make an informed dcision with regards to purchase. This role will interact with suppliers, business development director, eprocurement officers, product managers, sales team, and customer services.

<ns1:description>Full Stack Web Developer (Solid exp in Back-end development) - Join this award winning dot.com in Asia. Position is based in Bangkok, Thailand! Full relocation and visa sponsorship available! Java, C#, cassandra, ElasticSearch, Hadoop Junior (2 years+ - Senior Architects welcome to apply) - I am looking for 6-10 engineers to join this department. My Client: My client is one of the leading technology companies, not only in the industry but the world. At no point do they wish to be limited by the technology. As such, the right candidate will be exposed to numerous innovative technologies (including, but not limited to, big data, NOSQL). Cutting edge projects around personalization, machine learning, natural language processing. You will also be exposed to creating scalable infrastructure and architecture ensuring products can go from a few thousand calls per second to tens of thousands without any downtime or degradation in customer experience. The Role: My client is looking for engineering experts to ensure their website is the best of its kind in the world. This role is twofold, but for both you will be a technical expert. Primarily show real strength in back-end engineering. You will have real prowess in programming, architecture, scalability, distributed technologies. An in-depth understanding of TCP/IP, HTTP and how the web works will be crucial. Expertise in distributed platforms here will be a major plus (examples, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, Hadoop, CouchDB etc). They would expect back-end role experience of some key projects, ability to explain and justify your architecture. Attention to server side performance, measurements, big data analysis will also be a significant part of this role. Secondly, they would expect superb attention to detail of the performance of the web site on the browser. Familiarity and expertise in the latest technologies will be required. It is not enough to have a high-performing back-end but they absolutely must ensure the user has the best experience available. You will need to understand how the browser interprets the html, css, DOM etc. to produce pages that any user on any device will be able to interact and enjoy as soon as is possible. Ultimately Big Wednesday are looking for real technologists who have a great passion for creating robust, scalable and reliable architectures to support a fantastic end product. We want persons with innovative ideas on how to ensure that the customer is saved that last 100 milliseconds, so they can process TB&apos;s of data in minutes, or how to architect the server side to support tens of thousands of requests a second. What&apos;s in it for you? If successful you will receive good exposure to the business side, and be able to see and measure the true value of the work. Nothing is opaque at my client. They work in agile which for them does mean really focusing on business value as well as technological aptitude. Despite the success and size of the company they really operate with a start-up feel; you get to be part of choosing where and what you&apos;re working on, the technologies and how they solve the business concerns. Skill &amp; Experience Requirements: Technologies of interest (we are not expecting you to have them all) : Java (or other JVM languages), C# is acceptable Solid experience with UNIX shell scripts and O/S Node.js Cassandra / ElasticSearch / Hadoop Knockout.js, Angular.js, Gulp.js LESS, SASS Memcached, Redis Postgres, SQL Server, MySql Experience 2+ years experience min in a full stack role (we are also very keen to hear from senior developers up to Architects as we have 6 open roles) Good standard of English both written and spoken Please note this role is open to both Thai and International candidates.

<ns1:description>Full Stack Web Developer (Solid exp in Back-end development) - Join this award winning dot.com in Asia. Position is based in Bangkok, Thailand! Full relocation and visa sponsorship available! Java, C#, cassandra, ElasticSearch, Hadoop Junior (2 years+ - Senior Architects welcome to apply) - I am looking for 6-10 engineers to join this department. My Client: My client is one of the leading technology companies, not only in the industry but the world. At no point do they wish to be limited by the technology. As such, the right candidate will be exposed to numerous innovative technologies (including, but not limited to, big data, NOSQL). Cutting edge projects around personalization, machine learning, natural language processing. You will also be exposed to creating scalable infrastructure and architecture ensuring products can go from a few thousand calls per second to tens of thousands without any downtime or degradation in customer experience. The Role: My client is looking for engineering experts to ensure their website is the best of its kind in the world. This role is twofold, but for both you will be a technical expert. Primarily show real strength in back-end engineering. You will have real prowess in programming, architecture, scalability, distributed technologies. An in-depth understanding of TCP/IP, HTTP and how the web works will be crucial. Expertise in distributed platforms here will be a major plus (examples, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, Hadoop, CouchDB etc). They would expect back-end role experience of some key projects, ability to explain and justify your architecture. Attention to server side performance, measurements, big data analysis will also be a significant part of this role. Secondly, they would expect superb attention to detail of the performance of the web site on the browser. Familiarity and expertise in the latest technologies will be required. It is not enough to have a high-performing back-end but they absolutely must ensure the user has the best experience available. You will need to understand how the browser interprets the html, css, DOM etc. to produce pages that any user on any device will be able to interact and enjoy as soon as is possible. Ultimately Big Wednesday are looking for real technologists who have a great passion for creating robust, scalable and reliable architectures to support a fantastic end product. We want persons with innovative ideas on how to ensure that the customer is saved that last 100 milliseconds, so they can process TB&apos;s of data in minutes, or how to architect the server side to support tens of thousands of requests a second. What&apos;s in it for you? If successful you will receive good exposure to the business side, and be able to see and measure the true value of the work. Nothing is opaque at my client. They work in agile which for them does mean really focusing on business value as well as technological aptitude. Despite the success and size of the company they really operate with a start-up feel; you get to be part of choosing where and what you&apos;re working on, the technologies and how they solve the business concerns. Skill &amp; Experience Requirements: Technologies of interest (we are not expecting you to have them all) : Java (or other JVM languages), C# is acceptable Solid experience with UNIX shell scripts and O/S Node.js Cassandra / ElasticSearch / Hadoop Knockout.js, Angular.js, Gulp.js LESS, SASS Memcached, Redis Postgres, SQL Server, MySql Experience 2+ years experience min in a full stack role (we are also very keen to hear from senior developers up to Architects as we have 6 open roles) Good standard of English both written and spoken Please note this role is open to both Thai and International candidates.

<ns1:description>Full Stack Web Developer (Solid exp in Back-end development) - Join this award winning dot.com in Asia. Bangkok, Thailand! Full relocation and visa sponsorship available! Java, C#, cassandra, ElasticSearch, Hadoop Junior (2 years+ - Senior Architects welcome to apply) - I am looking for 6-10 engineers to join this department. My Client: My client is one of the leading technology companies, not only in the industry but the world. At no point do they wish to be limited by the technology. As such, the right candidate will be exposed to numerous innovative technologies (including, but not limited to, big data, NOSQL). Cutting edge projects around personalization, machine learning, natural language processing. You will also be exposed to creating scalable infrastructure and architecture ensuring products can go from a few thousand calls per second to tens of thousands without any downtime or degradation in customer experience. The Role: My client is looking for engineering experts to ensure their website is the best of its kind in the world. This role is twofold, but for both you will be a technical expert. Primarily show real strength in back-end engineering. You will have real prowess in programming, architecture, scalability, distributed technologies. An in-depth understanding of TCP/IP, HTTP and how the web works will be crucial. Expertise in distributed platforms here will be a major plus (examples, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, Hadoop, CouchDB etc). They would expect back-end role experience of some key projects, ability to explain and justify your architecture. Attention to server side performance, measurements, big data analysis will also be a significant part of this role. Secondly, they would expect superb attention to detail of the performance of the web site on the browser. Familiarity and expertise in the latest technologies will be required. It is not enough to have a high-performing back-end but they absolutely must ensure the user has the best experience available. You will need to understand how the browser interprets the html, css, DOM etc. to produce pages that any user on any device will be able to interact and enjoy as soon as is possible. Ultimately Big Wednesday are looking for real technologists who have a great passion for creating robust, scalable and reliable architectures to support a fantastic end product. We want persons with innovative ideas on how to ensure that the customer is saved that last 100 milliseconds, so they can process TB&apos;s of data in minutes, or how to architect the server side to support tens of thousands of requests a second. What&apos;s in it for you? If successful you will receive good exposure to the business side, and be able to see and measure the true value of the work. Nothing is opaque at my client. They work in agile which for them does mean really focusing on business value as well as technological aptitude. Despite the success and size of the company they really operate with a start-up feel; you get to be part of choosing where and what you&apos;re working on, the technologies and how they solve the business concerns. Skill &amp; Experience Requirements: Technologies of interest (we are not expecting you to have them all) : Java (or other JVM languages), C# is acceptable Solid experience with UNIX shell scripts and O/S Node.js Cassandra / ElasticSearch / Hadoop Knockout.js, Angular.js, Gulp.js LESS, SASS Memcached, Redis Postgres, SQL Server, MySql Experience 2+ years experience min in a full stack role (we are also very keen to hear from senior developers up to Architects as we have 6 open roles) Good standard of English both written and spoken Please note this role is open to both Thai and International candidates.

We perceive the strategic fundamentals of a business and understand how these translate into day to day operations, discern the relationships between business functions and expose how complex organisations are served by assets and technology. This gives us a unique perspective on capital investment, operational expenditure, how assets create business value and how organisations carry and manage risk. From boardroom down and technology up, our understanding of the complex, interconnected systems that make up a business enables us to create a line of sight between corporate strategy and asset operations, and to take on and solve the toughest problems for our most vital strategic infrastructure organisations What are we looking for?

You’ll spend the majority of your first year at college, learning the fundamentals of engineering. Outside of term time, you’ll compliment your studies working at your allocated facility. During your second year with us, you’ll continue to work within one of our expert teams whilst you further your qualifications at college two days a week. In later years, you’ll attend the prestigious University of Warwick on a block-release basis to study for a full engineering degree. WHERE IT WILL TAKE YOU As well as gaining commercial and professional experience, you’ll also achieve academic and vocational qualifications, such as: NVQ2 in Performing Engineering Operations NVQ3 in Business Improvement Techniques or NVQ3 Vocational Related Skills NVQ4 in Engineering Manufacturing Foundation degree A fully sponsored BEng degree in Applied Engineering REWARDS As a Degree Apprentice, your starting salary will be at least ?18,000 per year, increasing every six months on the condition that you continue to meet our expectations. Upon completion of the scheme you can expect to be earning over ?35,500 per year. We’ll also cover your tuition and course fees, and ensure you receive all the support and mentoring you need. A generous holiday allowance will also be yours, as will many other benefits. And with on-site facilities like gyms and sports hall, plus regular social events, you’ll have plenty of chances to make friends and have fun too. WHAT YOU’LL NEED To join the Engineering Degree Apprenticeship Scheme you’ll need five GCSEs at grades A*- C including Maths, English and a Science / Technology / Engineering related subject. In addition, you’ll also need two A Levels at grade C or above in Mathematical subjects or a combination of a Mathematical subject and Science, Technology or Engineering related subjects. A BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma qualification or equivalent in an Engineering or Technology related discipline (180 credits with a minimum of a merit award in the maths element) will also be considered.</ns1:description>

They are a relaxed environment - you will not find a suit/tie in the office! They also have plenty of perks that make them truly unique, including in house state of the art gym facilities (sauna/steam room), and in house chef who cooks for you (free breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner!) and a bar/pool table area! If you want to work with some of the best in the business, whilst having a lot of fun and making good friends along the way, you are urged to apply! Requirements: - A PHD with a large data-analysis and statistics component (Egg. genetics, Machine learning, High Energy physics) OR an MSc in Applied statistics, machine learning or similar - Commercial Data Science Experience - Data Analysis on Big Data and Big Data Technologies - Experience applying statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract insights from real data - Strong Technical Skills (e.g. software development, practical data analysis) - Strong communication skills with the ability to communicate complex research to non-technical personnel - Machine learning / Decision Techniques - Robust statistical interpretation of experimental data - Data Visualisation tools / GUI - Database design and querying (NoSQL ideal) - Mathematical modeling of physical data - R - Python - F# desirable - .NET ideal Lawrence Harvey is acting as an employment agency in regards to this position.</ns1:description>
