<ns2:requiresSkill rdf:resource="http://www.edsa-project.eu/skill/finance"/>
<ns1:description>FTSE 250 Tax Recruitment Consultant - Commerce &amp; Industry - 5 Reasons it could be right for you… High end advisory recruiting into the FTSE 250 Recruiting within the FTSE 250 is not an easy game, it is a skill set that recruiters with flair, credibility and gravitas can achieve. Your natural personality and likeability will put you in good stead to create a name for yourself within this market. This will take you from being a good recruiter to exceptional. 1 of 5 agencies who specialise in this area Within the tax market there are a handful or large agencies who have 1 or 2 dedicated people in Tax and they do not have the penetration that we have. In London there are 5 agencies who specialise purely in tax recruitment and have the brand in tax recruitment. Because of this we can dominate the market and blossom as opposed to working within a more generalist market such as Finance where the recruitment market has become saturated. Average Fee Size With average fees at a premium you can make a lot of commission very quickly and with only 4 placements a quarter you can be earning up to 40% Commission. Being Proud When we call clients and candidates within our market, our brand name is so well thought of that you can be proud on every single phone call that you make, every agency briefing that you attend, every client meeting, candidate meeting or external interview that you conduct. Being part of our business will make you proud to be &quot;Pro&quot;. The Team Above all, you will work with a team that is credible, knowledgeable and highly interactive. There is constant interaction on the desk about candidates and jobs, there is help at hand all of the time. We go out monthly to enhance the relationships in the team. We are motivated, happy and genuinely enjoy our work. This makes every single person in the Pro-Tax team an exceptional recruiter, we want people to join us and continue on this journey of constant improvement and career enhancement. Being at Pro-Tax isn&apos;t somewhere you will come for just a another job, people join Pro-Tax to develop a career. If you are serious about your career then please get in touch on or The Pro-Recruitment Groups consists of 3 distinct brands: Pro-Tax, Pro-Legal and Pro-Finance:</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>PHP developer Working for a growing company taking an existing application and also producing new dashboard and management applications for this technical IT consultancy&apos;s clients. The plan is that although this will start as a stand alone role you will get to grow a department around you so it would be a perfect opportunity for a developer with a couple of years experience in PHP looking to really make their mark and make the step up into development management. For that reason they will look at either strong developers who feel they could be a development manager but don&apos;t have the opportunity where they are or alternatively someone who is an okay developer with some project management skills - most important of all is a can do mentality and a desire to produce a great end product.
