We enable strategic decision-makers in the public and private sector to identify and implement sustainable solutions for reducing social and economic disadvantage in low- and middle-income countries. Supported by a multinational team of more than 160 full-time specialists on three continents, our success is based on a unique combination of high-quality analysis and 30 years’ practical experience of facilitating positive change in over 120 countries worldwide. The fields in which we operate range from health, education and the extractive industries through to public sector finance and administration, social welfare, and national statistical systems and household surveys. OPM is seeking to recruit three Assistant Consultants to work in its cross-cutting portfolio. The cross-cutting team is OPM’s entry point for talented and passionate individuals with limited experience or no particular specialisation to work in development consultancy, and progress by either specialising in one of the other technical areas, or remaining generalist. Skills are learnt through project work with senior consultants (including overseas fieldwork and ministry work as possible), a year-round training programme, and mentorship from an experienced senior consultant. We expect high performance, and reward it with promotions, salary increments and responsibility. The cross-cutting portfolio currently contains five assistant consultants, three consultants and one team leader who work on and sometimes lead consulting and research projects across the rest of OPM’s specialist portfolios. Successful applicants could expect to provide wide-ranging support to both project acquisition and implementation across all subject areas: Social policy, including teams in poverty reduction and social protection, health, and education; Economic policy, including teams in private sector development, financial sector development, trade, aid, microfinance, macroeconomic policy, climate change, and natural resource policy; Statistics, evidence and accountability, including teams in social development, official statistics, and political economy analysis; and Public sector finance and management, including team in public financial management, public management and accountability, debt management, and regional development and local government. Other areas of work (including food security, urban development, nutrition and agricultural development) are growing.

We expect assistant consultants to be promoted to consultants within two or three years, depending on performance. After promotion, consultants are expected to start progressively to manage their own projects, more frequently interacting directly with clients, and taking on greater autonomy and responsibility for providing advice to development policymakers. They may also take on greater people management responsibility, either for our regular interns or for other junior staff members. Applicants must have: An excellent academic record including a minimum 2:1 degree in Economics and a Masters in Economics, Social Science, Development Studies or a related field (to be completed by October 2015).

<ns1:description>Oxford Policy Management Oxford Policy Management Limited (OPM) is one of the world’s leading international policy development and management consultancies. We enable strategic decision-makers in the public and private sector to identify and implement sustainable solutions for reducing social and economic disadvantage in low- and middle-income countries. Supported by a multinational team of more than 160 full-time specialists on three continents, our success is based on a unique combination of high-quality analysis and 30 years’ practical experience of facilitating positive change in over 120 countries worldwide. The fields in which we operate range from health, education and the extractive industries through to public sector finance and administration, social welfare, and national statistical systems and household surveys. OPM is seeking to recruit three Assistant Consultants to work in its cross-cutting portfolio. The cross-cutting team is OPM’s entry point for talented and passionate individuals with limited experience or no particular specialisation to work in development consultancy, and progress by either specialising in one of the other technical areas, or remaining generalist. Skills are learnt through project work with senior consultants (including overseas fieldwork and ministry work as possible), a year-round training programme, and mentorship from an experienced senior consultant. We expect high performance, and reward it with promotions, salary increments and responsibility. The cross-cutting portfolio currently contains five assistant consultants, three consultants and one team leader who work on and sometimes lead consulting and research projects across the rest of OPM’s specialist portfolios.

<ns1:description>We&apos;re recruiting on behalf of one of the UK&apos;s best loved consumer brands for a Head of Customer Analytics. Your remit will be to lead a talented team of modellers and statistical insight professionals, driving the strategy and agenda for how this function services the thirst for actionable insight within the business. They&apos;re looking for a heavy hitter, someone with gravitas and impact which will be demonstrated through your CV where you talk about driving commercial results and demonstrable change within a business, not just technically about modelling and analysis techniques. That said you&apos;ve got to know and understand the subject matter so you&apos;re able to demonstrate to the function what good looks like too. So coming from a practitioner pedigree in your earlier career would be useful but not essential. Your team will be made up of onsite and offshore resource covering three core areas: - Customer acquisition - driving improved acquisition insight for prospecting and supporting the growth of the business - Existing customer management - leading a team of modellers and analysts who look at the existing customer base, looking to reduce churn, downgrading, cross and up sell initiatives - Viewing data insight - looking at content decisioning, advertising insight and customer management across their TV platform Your team will be up to 20 reports, with the bulk of support being local and a smaller offshore contingent. Your engagement will be with the business&apos; executive team and very senior leaders across the marketing and commercial divisions. You will be the right-hand person to the divisional director for this business area too. THE BUSINESS As mentioned earlier, they&apos;re one of the UK&apos;s best loved consumer brands. But what&apos;s remarkable about this business is its engagement level with employees. They&apos;ve developed a highly collaborative culture which cares and invests in its people and it&apos;s genuinely felt by them too. As a recruiter, I&apos;ve rarely come across such positive sentiment which is shared and remarked upon by employees from so many different divisions of this company. They all remark positively on things like empowerment, a true entrepreneurial spirit across the business and real pride in the brand. Where opportunities to join high performance career acceleration programmes exist as well as really meaty projects to get your teeth into. It&apos;s also a business with more than 10,000 employees and in excess of 5 million customers, and offers multiple products and services across the TMT space. So if you&apos;ve got the pedigree and appetite to tackle a challenge like this and want to know more, please contact Colin Doree at Blue Pelican today!
