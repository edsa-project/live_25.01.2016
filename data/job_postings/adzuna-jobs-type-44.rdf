On offer is a generous salary and benefits package, and the opportunity to work in a focussed team on varied and challenging projects. Working in a collaborative and supportive environment, you’ll also quickly take on responsibilities for managing projects and clients, and have the chance to develop and gain new skills in software or hardware. But you’ll have to be one of the best to be considered by this company. If you think that’s you, don’t hesitate to apply now!

<ns1:description>Here is a rare opportunity for a Support Consultant / Support Analyst who has strong ERP software support experience and understands manufacturing and business processes, to cross train as a C#.Net, SQL Server ERP Software Developer. You may have some programming and development skills from university, or you may be a hobby programmer at home - you need to prove you are not frightened of changing direction into software development and that you are outgoing, and can talk happily to clients about their business processes and what changes they want to their software. This role is to join a team of developers who are client facing and focused on working with the existing ERP solution and making improvements to it, that specifically suit their clients. It&apos;s a busy team happily chatting to project managers and the support people and sharing ideas. It&apos;s less of a back room techie programming role and more of a consulting type of development job for someone who is gregarious and communicative. You need to have used some programming languages - even if it is just VBA and Excel or Java and JavaScript; ideally you will know something about SQL Server and .Net but they will train you up. Salary from ?25 - 35k depending on your background, plus pension and benefits. Typically projects are: *Software customisation *Plug-ins *New fields *New screens *New functions *Reports This is to develop the existing software solution and it needs someone who is really interested in doing what the customer wants and making it work, rather than trying to produce perfectly designed code that would win a programming competition. It might be that the solution is a 10 minute fix or it could be a week of investigation, but your role is to understand the client&apos;s business requirement and solve the puzzle of how to develop it to meet their needs. You must have a strong ERP software background, probably in Application Support or Implementation, or Consultancy. You will have an understanding of business processes and manufacturing and will like talking to clients. You should also be able to demonstrate a keen interest in software development and will have used some programming languages in your spare time at home, or during your studies. They will train you up as an ERP Software Developer working in a SQL Server, .Net, C# development environment. There is a completely separate development team of techies in a different office, working on new product development. This is a fabulous role for someone with ERP support experience and some programming skills, to train up as a client facing .Net Software Developer. Contact Jake King or Carolyn MacLurg at Ambis Resourcing to learn more about this great opportunity.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Java Developer - Specialist Payment Solutions Company My client is a leading is a small specialist business in Crawley that focusses on offering bespoke payment solutions, including online and telephone. They create clever systems designed for the task at hand to create functional and secure systems that can handle large amounts of payment data. They are currently recruiting for a java developer to join their growing team. You will have a good handle on coding in java, and probably some other languages, databases and general IT knowledge. But to emphasise - you will be passionate about all things java and object oriented programming! Because they are a small business, although you need to be a top coder, at times the role may involve an element of project management, analysis and client interaction. On the other hand, you may need to do the odd bit of what could be classed as IT support. So you need to be flexible and adaptable to really thrive in a role that can be varied. You will need to have a minimum of six to twelve months commercial java development experience in order to be considered for this role. Your typical week might include: Developing and maintaining customer applications for the payments market Research &amp; development into new and innovative products and solutions Providing support for existing products, testing and rolling-out of solutions Investigating and troubleshooting operational issues Working closely with other developers and managers You will be given full product training and will be part of a continuous learning program supported by regular training. If you have experience with MySQL, Apache, Tomcat, RabbitMQ and Linux this will be desirable (but not mandatory). Interested? Please click the apply button below and include a cover letter explaining your passion for java and motivation for this role.

<ns1:description>QA Engineers with 1 to 3 years experience (manual or automation) are sought by this technology-driven FTSE100 company to join their Development team as a Software Development Engineer In Test and take part in a 6 month on-the-job-training period where they will be taught to program in Java. This position is a permanent position from day one, but the training will be a well funded, structured training session for a period of 6 months where technologists who have a passion for QA and automating as much of the test process as possible will be trained to become a Software Development Engineer In Test who uses Java to build software that tests software. WHAT IS A &quot;SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER IN TEST&quot;? &quot;A Software Development Engineer In Test … is a QA but the focus is on writing automated tests rather than on creating and running manual test cases. Think of it as writing software to test software. It can be a particularly challenging career choice because it takes both programming skill and a good understanding of software testing.&quot; So in summary its: - A QA - who can write Java code - and use that code to write software to test software WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? In many technology-driven company QA ends up being the poor relation to the development team. However at this FTSE100 company they want their SDET career path to be just as prestigious and as enviable as a developer career path. So they have beefed up their own existing SDET team with seniors from Amazon and Google at the higher end of the corporate ladder, and at the junior end they want to invest heavily in a class of Software Development Engineers In Test who will be well trained and highly technically competent. This company is committed to building a world-class Software Development Engineer In Test team!! WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR? This company hires on behaviours and not skills, so rather than look for the finished article, they are looking to hire Test Analysts and QAs with 1 to 3 years experience who: - have a computer science, or numerate degree (Physics, Biochem, Maths, etc) - have some level of experience writing code - have chosen a career in testing and QA - have a track record of pushing themselves to excel at the things they are passionate about what they do Any experience with Test Automation tools like Selenium, QTP, TDD, Unit testing, Jenkins or API driven testing would be desirable although not essential. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO YOU? - This Academy will be the first step on a challenging and rewarding career path - The SDET job title is a new job role for which demand will increase exponentially over the coming years - This is an opportunity to receive a solid investment in your career development, in both a formal and informal setting - Working for a prestigious FTSE100 company - A chance to go through a learning process with a group of like-minded peers, supporting and learning from each other along the way - A way to train and be paid at the same time - Work on a series of technology challenges that simply cannot be found elsewhere: - The volumes of a telco but with a variety of new, greenfield pieces of work - Pace of a start-up but work for a highly profitable and well organised company - Complexity of the challenges at a bank but without the stuffy environment - The relaxed, flexible environment of the media sector, but working on cutting edge technologies on ground breaking systems - Working for a company that is fun to work for</ns1:description>
