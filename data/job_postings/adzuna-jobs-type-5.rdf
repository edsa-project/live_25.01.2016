<ns1:description>Senior Insight Consultant - SAS &amp; SQL CLIENT *Exciting, ground breaking marketing proposition *Opportunity to be involved with a start up from early phases *Working amongst industry leaders in loyalty and marketing analytics I&apos;m seeking an experienced Senior Analyst - SAS &amp; SQL to join this newly established online marketing service provider. With a number of the UK&apos;s largest retail banks already working as partners and an ever increasing client base of UK retailers, this is an amazing opportunity to join an entrepreneurial, creative and fast growing start-up. It&apos;s a brand new role working on a unique analytics and marketing proposition being launched here in the UK. This is a very exciting opportunity for either a newly established, hungry analyst OR an experienced determined analyst looking to take a step into a supporting role (you will be working closely with your manager, one of the Directors of Analytics). Ultimately, you will be conducting lots of exploratory analysis and automation, working at 100 miles an hour, using lateral thinking for analytical problem solving. It&apos;s a great time to be joining the team, who are backed by one of the largest loyalty consultancies in the UK, with an already established parent company flourishing in the US. You will be working within a big data environment, with the opportunity to work closely with impressive Directors and retail clients as well as supporting your manager on developing the function. Ideally you should have a combined background in Retail and data agency; however, strong experience of working in an analytical capacity with very large volumes of customer transactional data will be considered; SQL and SAS skills essential.

<ns1:description>Lead Risk Analyst - Nottingham - Permanent - ?35000 - ?45000 plus bens Large Nottingham based company - a leader in their field, seeks a new additional Risk Analyst. As a Lead Risk Analyst within the UK Credit Risk team you will be responsible for managing the companies growing credit risk exposures through on-going portfolio analysis and reporting and the management, optimisation and development of credit strategies across the whole customer lifecycle (from acquisition through to debt recovery) and subsequently driving the business forward through the generation of recommendations. Ideally suited to someone with :- • At least 3 or 4 years analytical experience and you are looking for your next step. • You are self-motivated and organised. You love structure and process, and some may even say you’re a little on the geeky side. My client likes that but not so geeky that you can’t talk to others - we want you to work between Credit, Group and the business so strong communication is important. • You are logical, analytical, and methodical. You have a natural curiosity that means you thrive on investigating data through analysis and its subsequent review and interpretation to provide great insight to the business in a simple easily understood way. • You enjoy statistical analysis and modelling and would flourish in working in collaboration with the central risk analytics team in the head office and C&amp;R teams in the branches to make recommendations for model redevelopment and provide expert oversight to ensure analytics are statistically valid and in line with local risk requirements and specification. What this role isn’t - This role is not a scorecard builder day in day out, nor is it a code developer and you don’t need to be a techie. But if you have experience in building a wide variety of statistical models and are looking for the opportunity to provide expert oversight and challenge other people’s analytics that would do nicely. If you understand how to apply analytics to develop credit risk strategy and effectively implement it into the business, even better. What will they give you? • You will have a unique opportunity to become part of an extremely proficient credit team. • You will have exposure to all areas of credit risk and other business areas through involvement in business wide project work. * If you have the follow systems experience this would also be an advantage :- SAS EG and Qlikview. Anyone with SAS/SPSS/Angoss/SQL experience would be suitable. • You will become part of an organisation which considers personal development paramount and encourages everyone to seek out progression opportunities both in the UK offices and abroad.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Immediate Start! Team Leader needed - London Harnham is the leading provider of recruitment services and advice to the Data &amp; Analytics marketplace. Due to excessive growth over the last 12 months, we are currently looking for an ambitious, experienced Team Leader to join us. The role will be split between billing and managing a successful team of consultants whilst also leading our presence in the Finance Analytics marketplace. This is a great opportunity for someone who isn&apos;t getting the chance to progress in their current role or someone looking to be more involved within a company. Harnham is still privately owned and the possibility of becoming a Partner is very realistic. Other benefits we offer include - very competitive commission structure (based on the performance of your team &amp; individual billings), 5* luxury holidays, lunch clubs, gym membership, free fruit, interest-free travel loan, regular socials and full training (should you require it!)… Candidates with recruitment experience within Data &amp; Analytics would be a bonus but essentially we&apos;re looking for recruiters with a proven track record in any professional services industry. Finance recruitment would be our second choice but again not essential. You will however need to have a minimum of 2.5 years&apos; experience. Harnham is very proud of its reputation in the market; interested candidates will therefore need to be good at building long-lasting relationships and be able to show evidence of this. You will also need to be ambitious, resilient and money-motivated. There is a very inclusive culture at Harnham so being a team player is equally as important. The future for Harnham is extremely exciting. We&apos;ve spent the last almost 10 years cementing our name in the market as a professional, quality-driven company with a remarkable client list. We opened an office in New York in the summer and the opportunity to progress has never been stronger. If this sounds like a position you would like to hear more about, apply here or contact Georgina Howell at Harnham. All conversations are completely confidential. Key words: Team Leader, Senior Recruitment Consultant, Sales Manager, Recruitment Manager, Managing Consultant, London, Recruitment, Finance, Data &amp; Analytics</ns1:description>
