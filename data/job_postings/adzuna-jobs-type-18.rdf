The successful applicant will work on the VectorBase project, which focuses on invertebrate species that transmit diseases to humans and animals. VectorBase (http://vectorbase.org) is a leading database serving the research community working on pathogenic diseases, and has played an important role in the annotation, and subsequent dissemination, of the genomes of many key species including mosquitoes, flies and lice. VectorBase is an international consortium comprised of three collaborating laboratories and EMBL-EBI&apos;s role focuses on genome annotation, variation, and preparing data for public release. We are currently looking to recruit a bioinformatician to work on developing new search and web interfaces for genetic variation resources. The applicant can expect, if appointed, to work on integrating Elasticsearch/Solr search technologies with existing Ensembl web components for data visualisation, and developing novel data visualisation tools for sample and variation data. The post-holder will also contribute to Ensembl Metazoa, the EBI&apos;s own portal for providing public access to genomic data from vector and non-vector species, and will work as part of a group of closely collaborating teams using the Ensembl platform for a wide variety of species from across the taxonomic space. Based on the funding currently available, this post is being offered for one year, although other opportunities may arise to continue working on the project beyond that date.

Java, C#, cassandra, ElasticSearch, Hadoop Junior (2 years+ - Senior Architects welcome to apply) - I am looking for 6-10 engineers to join this department. My Client: My client is one of the leading technology companies, not only in the industry but the world. At no point do they wish to be limited by the technology. As such, the right candidate will be exposed to numerous innovative technologies (including, but not limited to, big data, NOSQL). Cutting edge projects around personalization, machine learning, natural language processing. You will also be exposed to creating scalable infrastructure and architecture ensuring products can go from a few thousand calls per second to tens of thousands without any downtime or degradation in customer experience. The Role: My client is looking for engineering experts to ensure their website is the best of its kind in the world. This role is twofold, but for both you will be a technical expert. Primarily show real strength in back-end engineering. You will have real prowess in programming, architecture, scalability, distributed technologies. An in-depth understanding of TCP/IP, HTTP and how the web works will be crucial. Expertise in distributed platforms here will be a major plus (examples, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, Hadoop, CouchDB etc). They would expect back-end role experience of some key projects, ability to explain and justify your architecture. Attention to server side performance, measurements, big data analysis will also be a significant part of this role. Secondly, they would expect superb attention to detail of the performance of the web site on the browser. Familiarity and expertise in the latest technologies will be required. It is not enough to have a high-performing back-end but they absolutely must ensure the user has the best experience available. You will need to understand how the browser interprets the html, css, DOM etc. to produce pages that any user on any device will be able to interact and enjoy as soon as is possible. Ultimately Big Wednesday are looking for real technologists who have a great passion for creating robust, scalable and reliable architectures to support a fantastic end product. We want persons with innovative ideas on how to ensure that the customer is saved that last 100 milliseconds, so they can process TB&apos;s of data in minutes, or how to architect the server side to support tens of thousands of requests a second. What&apos;s in it for you? If successful you will receive good exposure to the business side, and be able to see and measure the true value of the work. Nothing is opaque at my client. They work in agile which for them does mean really focusing on business value as well as technological aptitude. Despite the success and size of the company they really operate with a start-up feel; you get to be part of choosing where and what you&apos;re working on, the technologies and how they solve the business concerns. Skill &amp; Experience Requirements: Technologies of interest (we are not expecting you to have them all) : Java (or other JVM languages), C# is acceptable Solid experience with UNIX shell scripts and O/S Node.js Cassandra / ElasticSearch / Hadoop Knockout.js, Angular.js, Gulp.js LESS, SASS Memcached, Redis Postgres, SQL Server, MySql Experience 2+ years experience min in a full stack role (we are also very keen to hear from senior developers up to Architects as we have 6 open roles) Good standard of English both written and spoken Please note this role is open to both Thai and International candidates.

Full relocation and visa sponsorship available! Java, C#, cassandra, ElasticSearch, Hadoop Junior (2 years+ - Senior Architects welcome to apply) - I am looking for 6-10 engineers to join this department. My Client: My client is one of the leading technology companies, not only in the industry but the world. At no point do they wish to be limited by the technology. As such, the right candidate will be exposed to numerous innovative technologies (including, but not limited to, big data, NOSQL). Cutting edge projects around personalization, machine learning, natural language processing. You will also be exposed to creating scalable infrastructure and architecture ensuring products can go from a few thousand calls per second to tens of thousands without any downtime or degradation in customer experience. The Role: My client is looking for engineering experts to ensure their website is the best of its kind in the world. This role is twofold, but for both you will be a technical expert. Primarily show real strength in back-end engineering. You will have real prowess in programming, architecture, scalability, distributed technologies. An in-depth understanding of TCP/IP, HTTP and how the web works will be crucial. Expertise in distributed platforms here will be a major plus (examples, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, Hadoop, CouchDB etc). They would expect back-end role experience of some key projects, ability to explain and justify your architecture. Attention to server side performance, measurements, big data analysis will also be a significant part of this role. Secondly, they would expect superb attention to detail of the performance of the web site on the browser. Familiarity and expertise in the latest technologies will be required. It is not enough to have a high-performing back-end but they absolutely must ensure the user has the best experience available. You will need to understand how the browser interprets the html, css, DOM etc. to produce pages that any user on any device will be able to interact and enjoy as soon as is possible. Ultimately Big Wednesday are looking for real technologists who have a great passion for creating robust, scalable and reliable architectures to support a fantastic end product. We want persons with innovative ideas on how to ensure that the customer is saved that last 100 milliseconds, so they can process TB&apos;s of data in minutes, or how to architect the server side to support tens of thousands of requests a second. What&apos;s in it for you? If successful you will receive good exposure to the business side, and be able to see and measure the true value of the work. Nothing is opaque at my client. They work in agile which for them does mean really focusing on business value as well as technological aptitude. Despite the success and size of the company they really operate with a start-up feel; you get to be part of choosing where and what you&apos;re working on, the technologies and how they solve the business concerns. Skill &amp; Experience Requirements: Technologies of interest (we are not expecting you to have them all) : Java (or other JVM languages), C# is acceptable Solid experience with UNIX shell scripts and O/S Node.js Cassandra / ElasticSearch / Hadoop Knockout.js, Angular.js, Gulp.js LESS, SASS Memcached, Redis Postgres, SQL Server, MySql Experience 2+ years experience min in a full stack role (we are also very keen to hear from senior developers up to Architects as we have 6 open roles) Good standard of English both written and spoken Please note this role is open to both Thai and International candidates.
