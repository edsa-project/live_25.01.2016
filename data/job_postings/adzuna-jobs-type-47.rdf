<ns1:description>The Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) is an international centre for scientific research situated in Grenoble, France. We are Europe&apos;s leading neutron science facility. We receive over 2000 visiting scientists per year to carry out world-class research in a wide variety of scientific fields.The ILL upgrade programme and the European SINE2020 project have a common goal to foster a collective, Europe-wide approach to data reduction and analysis that will transform data treatment for neutron scattering experiments for the decade to come. The Computing for Science (CS) Group in the ILL’s Science Division is therefore currently recruiting: Three Scientific Software Programmers (M/F) Duties: The mission of the CS Group is to deliver and support the critical data treatment software that enables visiting scientists to exploit their scattering data effectively during experiments.In this context, your duties will focus primarily on data reduction for a range of instruments in the Mantid code [www.mantidproject.org]. The work includes: writing loaders for ILL data which is in the NeXus/HDF5 format, implementing data reduction workflows based as far as possible on existing algorithms in the Mantid code, adding new algorithms, where necessary, validating results against existing software and implementing graphical user interfaces, interacting with scientists and software developers to ensure that software is delivered in a timely and effective manner. Qualifications and experience: You have - at least - a Master’s degree in a physical science or software engineering. You are: a software developer interested in working in a leading scientific facility or a scientist with a strong track-record in software development, expert in Python and C++ programming and familiar with the modern software development methods and environment (e.g. Eclipse, GitHub…), service-oriented and a committed team player in order to work effectively with members of the CS group, scientists and European partners. Language skills: As an international research centre, we are particularly keen to attract applicants from outside France. You must have a sound knowledge of English and be willing to learn French (a language course will be paid for by the ILL). Knowledge of German would be an advantage. Notes: 36-month fixed-term contracts For further information, contact Mark Johnson, Head of Computing for Science and coordinator of the SINE2020 project. Benefits: Generous company benefits (expatriation allowance), relocation assistance and language courses may be offered for you and your spouse (for more information, please consult our employment conditions). How to apply: Please submit your application on-line, no later than 03/01/2016, via our web site: (vacancy reference: 15/22).The interviews will take place on week 4 of 2016.

The main product is the software product which is subject to regular releases. Similar companies include, Quant hedge funds, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Matlab etc. You must understand the importance of hitting production software releases. You will be using Git and Jira so it is important you are familiar with them as a minimum and software cycles. If you have project management experience and love working with big data and cloud solutions then you will love this company. The Company wants people who buy into the company as opposed to just being money orientated. Whilst you will get a good salary you will also receive share options which will more than likely be worth loads when the company floats one day. If you are the type of person who relishes working with a start-up that is growing exponentially and enjoy the camaraderie associated with it then this opportunity is for you. Please forward your CV urgently to Elliot Wald.</ns1:description>
