<ns1:description>Finance Analyst Cheltenham ?20,000 - ?24,000 A fantastic opportunity has arisen to join this market-leading Cheltenham-based organisation as a Finance Analyst. Supporting a range of cost centre managers and senior stakeholders across the business, this would particularly suit a recent graduate who has gained work experience in the form of either an internship or as a result of their first post-university position. The role is a blend of financial reporting, analysis, process improvement and business as usual month-end duties such as accruals, prepayments, journals and reconciliations. You will assist in cost centre reviews and will engage with project teams to track performance against budget, collating data and reporting on capex spend. This mix of analysis and stakeholder engagement will require someone with an eye for detail and the highest standards of accuracy. It is expected that you will have at least a basic understanding of general ledger and balance sheet management and that you will be familiar with the likes of journals and reconciliations and understand the double entry process. It is also important that you have strong Excel skills. Knowledge of SAP would be preferable but not essential. The successful candidate will have good communication skills and be able to provide management information to senior colleagues in a timely fashion. You will also possess good organisation skills and will have relevant previous experience and be eager to continue a professional qualification.</ns1:description>

There will be some KPI analysis and meeting with heads of departments to discuss why targets are being missed/achieved (i.e business partnering). Candidates need to be decisive enough to challenge senior members in the business and provide new ideas to increase efficiency. They will be liaising with the Commercial Finance Manager in terms of advising on the financial viability of bids, proposals and commercial contracts. Successful applicants will also be liaising with stakeholders. Applicants should be pursuing their ACCA, ACA or CIMA qualification and have a good level of practical experience with an accountancy package such as SAP, Oracle or SUN. Excel forms a significant part of the role; candidates will need to be highly adept with building pivot tables, v-look ups and formulas. Experience with macros would be a bonus. My client has a preference for candidates currently working in the insurance or financial services sector. The role is an incredibly progressive position and candidates have a real opportunity to become future leaders within the company if they exhibit the right attitude and personality.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>An international chemicals business are initiating a project to deliver the next generation of HR services and seek a person to fulfil the task of business case lead. The scope of the project covers HR, Payroll and associated service and will include looking at the current business organisation (internal and vendors), processes and systems. We are establishing the project team in Manchester and wish to appoint someone to take responsibility for the development of the business case. The appointee will be responsible for capturing the baseline data about the current operation of the relevant business processes, building a cost model that supports them and then working with the solution architect and systems providers to understand the cost of change and the potential benefits to be derived. We are looking for someone with an established track record of supporting such a technologically-enabled change project in a large corporate organisation. We expect the successful candidate to be able to demonstrate capability and understanding in the following areas: Business case development: A full understanding of the analytical techniques required to design the analytical model, identify the sources and means of data capture (including activity sampling), populate the model and evaluate the options. It is expected that the successful candidate will play the major part in carrying out these activities. HR Transformation: An understanding of the approaches to building a world class HR service delivery model based on a demonstrable grasp of HR business processes and their implications for the business. Options development: The ability to support the formulation of options for consideration and identify the implementation implications of each. Analysis and modelling skills in large scale business projects. As this is a technologically enabled change project, an understanding of IT applications and their dependencies will be required sufficient to identify, understand and analyse the impact on the project. It is likely the successful candidate will have demonstrable analytical capability that will have been earned in a financial or analytical environment. They will be part of an initial programme team of four and report to the HR Next Generation Programme Lead. It is Wells Tobias Recruitment Solutions’ policy, as a matter of courtesy, to respond to all applications within three working days. However because of the volume of applications, we are sometimes unable to respond to individual applicants. If we have not contacted you within three working days your application has been unsuccessful and your details have not been retained. Please apply for any other position that you may see in the future. Thank you.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Due to an increase in workload within the team, South West Water is looking for two Data Analysts to undertake the migration of data from one SCADA system to a new one and put together digital drawings of site information to use as reference points for the alarms team. We are looking for an enthusiastic and capable person who will help us deliver our business plan and maintain a high standard of service to our internal and external customers. You will be part of a challenging and stimulating environment providing state-of-the-art technology for business-critical applications, in a dedicated and professional project delivery team. Working on critical technology that gives us visibility and remote control of our physical assets at site locations across the region, you will help us deploy a brand new industry-leading telemetry system and provide support to the operational business groups who rely on it for maintaining the water and sewerage services to South West Water&apos;s customers. The role of the SCADA Data Analyst is to ensure the quality and integrity of data used by the in-house Telemetry and Process Control systems that support core business functions. The analyst will apply proven communication, analytical, and problem-solving skills to help resolve issues in order to maximise the benefit of systems investments. You will work on two key projects supporting the migration of information from the ageing, obsolete system being replaced, to the new cutting-edge system: Data Cleanse and Site Mimic Build. Data Cleanse involves the extraction of data, its subsequent validation and replacement where necessary with improved data, using macro-enabled spreadsheets. Site Mimic Build involves the use of the new system SCOPE-X to develop simple graphical representations of assets and their processes at site locations across the SWW region. The role involves working to set instructions and then interrogating the data in order to resolve issues and update ready for transfer to the new system. The ideal candidates must be happy working with large spreadsheets on a daily basis and have a strong analytical capability and experience in problem solving. You must also possess good communication skills, be organised and have the ability to stay calm under pressure.

There will also be a requirement to provide analysis for a number of smaller clients. In addition, ad-hoc support will be required across the entire team and in supporting the internal reporting requirements. The role requires close communication both internally with the Account Management teams and externally with the client. This role is within the UK Business Intelligence team, which in turn is part of the Global Business Intelligence function.

Key Areas of Activity: • Working with the Senior Business Analyst &amp; the outsourced client’s Travel Manager to determine client reporting requirements – content, frequency and delivery schedules.

The role sits within the Research &amp; Insight function, part of the wider GB&amp;I and Nordics Marketing Teams. Joining this fast paced team, you&apos;ll own the reporting requirements across this function. This is what we want you to do... 1. Create and deliver market and financial-based reports to help steer the business * Build a deep &amp; comprehensive understanding of market data, including GfK EPOS sales data, consumer panel data and internal sales data * Create and produce regular market reports using GfK EPOS sales data for a variety of stakeholders (Sales, Marketing, Finance, Board) * Deliver ad-hoc market reports as required 2. Support the Research and Insight Analyst with: * Production of annual market reviews for GB,I&amp;N Exec in preparation for the yearly budget. * Identify and keep abreast of changing trends, issues and opportunities facing Dyson and the wider market. * Monitoring competitor activity. * Support ad-hoc projects as required. 3. Assist when required the Research and Insight Manager by creating and maintaining: * Brand health tracking reports. * NPS and repurchase reports. * Shopper journey reports. This is what we want you to have... * Advanced Excel skills. * Ability to deliver under pressure and to tight deadlines. * Relentless attention to detail. * Experience of using databases to manipulate and extract data. * Ideally, some experience of analysing market/sales data in a commercial environment. * Educated to degree level (or equivalent). * Self-starter with lots of initiative. * Fix things that you can see need fixing. * Identify problems and find solutions.</ns1:description>
