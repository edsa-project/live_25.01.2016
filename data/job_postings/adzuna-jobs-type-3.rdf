<ns1:description>Lead Risk Analyst - Nottingham - Permanent - ?35000 - ?45000 plus bens Large Nottingham based company - a leader in their field, seeks a new additional Risk Analyst. As a Lead Risk Analyst within the UK Credit Risk team you will be responsible for managing the companies growing credit risk exposures through on-going portfolio analysis and reporting and the management, optimisation and development of credit strategies across the whole customer lifecycle (from acquisition through to debt recovery) and subsequently driving the business forward through the generation of recommendations. Ideally suited to someone with :- • At least 3 or 4 years analytical experience and you are looking for your next step. • You are self-motivated and organised. You love structure and process, and some may even say you’re a little on the geeky side. My client likes that but not so geeky that you can’t talk to others - we want you to work between Credit, Group and the business so strong communication is important. • You are logical, analytical, and methodical. You have a natural curiosity that means you thrive on investigating data through analysis and its subsequent review and interpretation to provide great insight to the business in a simple easily understood way. • You enjoy statistical analysis and modelling and would flourish in working in collaboration with the central risk analytics team in the head office and C&amp;R teams in the branches to make recommendations for model redevelopment and provide expert oversight to ensure analytics are statistically valid and in line with local risk requirements and specification. What this role isn’t - This role is not a scorecard builder day in day out, nor is it a code developer and you don’t need to be a techie. But if you have experience in building a wide variety of statistical models and are looking for the opportunity to provide expert oversight and challenge other people’s analytics that would do nicely. If you understand how to apply analytics to develop credit risk strategy and effectively implement it into the business, even better. What will they give you? • You will have a unique opportunity to become part of an extremely proficient credit team. • You will have exposure to all areas of credit risk and other business areas through involvement in business wide project work. * If you have the follow systems experience this would also be an advantage :- SAS EG and Qlikview. Anyone with SAS/SPSS/Angoss/SQL experience would be suitable. • You will become part of an organisation which considers personal development paramount and encourages everyone to seek out progression opportunities both in the UK offices and abroad.</ns1:description>

The candidate must also be proactive, have an analytical mind-set and be able to work effectively both as an individual and as part of a team. The role itself will involve a variety of work, ranging from regular reporting and Board paper preparation, through to projects and ad hoc tasks. As more than one task is likely to require completion at any one point in time, sometimes at short notice, you must be organised with the ability to work flexibly. As an Underwriting Analyst, you will be required to liaise with multiple teams - both underwriting and operational - across the company. Good interpersonal skills and the confidence to seek and question information from employees, including senior staff, are therefore a prerequisite.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Senior Insight Analyst The role: This opportunity sits within the portfolio and customer insight division of one of the big TMT players. You will be joining a team of around 11 within a much bigger analytics and CRM division of more than 100. This is an additional headcount position within the team as they look to expand their capability. The business has a growing thirst for actionable insight and as a senior member of the team, you will be leading a small unit of (3-4) insight partners, helping to investigate and answer the big business questions/challenges and what matters. You will be in demand from the wider business and will need to build solid relationships and partnerships across the marketing and commercial divisions. Teasing out and building upon questions posed by the business, then structuring the analysis and presenting it back in an actionable way. One of the key measures of success within this role is &apos;actionable insight&apos; and the effect you&apos;ve had in helping to drive change/results and steer business success through insight. All data sources will be available to you, both structured and un-structured to leverage insight from. Which will include all channels, on and offline too. Because of the business demand, you will need to be able to prioritise work stacks, the team and balance business priorities, considering quality and cost factors as part of the process. The majority of the team and wider stakeholder group you will be interacting with are in London, so there is a preference to appointing someone who&apos;s able to work from there, however they have said they can be flexible with this. This role is hands-on, but the split will be roughly 80% knowing how to use data and do actionable insight and the remaining 20% with the analytics - but your skills and capabilities are anticipated to be top-notch so you can get things done quickly and efficiently. Technical tools knowledge They need someone with polished SQL skills as a fundamental. But from an statistical/analytical tools perspective, SAS, SPSS, R, Python are all fine. They&apos;ve just re-platformed to R for most of their analysis work, but don&apos;t expect to appoint an R specialist. Other things they look for Outside of the &apos;driving insights&apos; piece mentioned above, they&apos;re looking for: - Experience handling large datasets, the kind you&apos;d anticipate using within a business which has millions of customers. - Technically excellent at presenting back recommendations and findings to business stakeholders, having some experience of utilising a data visualisation tool like Tableau would be beneficial for this - Great communication skills - able to engage and put into context the questions been posed and what does the solution presented mean to the business - Great numerical skills, preferably backed by academic achievement - You are able to demonstrate where and how you&apos;ve made a difference to a business, driving commercial success through insight So if this is something you would be interested in exploring further, please get in touch and let&apos;s discuss asap.

<ns1:description>Have you recently completed your PhD or MSc in a numerate subject matter from a top-tier University, and are you looking to get into the exciting world of Data Science? If doing this for an established Consultancy within the Financial Services sector appeals, read on! The business is part of a very large, multi-national corporate brand. But are innovative, agile and entrepreneurial. They have to be, since they&apos;re a consultancy who carry out projects on behalf of a wide array of external clients. You will be joining a team of 4, within a wider division of 30. The work you will be taking on will offer variety and the chance to learn so much because of the kinds of projects you will undertake for end clients. For example, you could be working on a range of optimisation or propensity models, working across a portfolio of financial products and services. You could also be working across behavioural economics, notably linking behavioural analytics to economics. This is an exciting opportunity for a recent graduate who has the relevant qualifications in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance with significant exposure to quantitative analytics and a good basis within computational programming utilising a recognised analysis/modelling tool. This is a Big Data environment and it&apos;s expected you will be comfortable taking on a role that&apos;s got a lot of emphasis on programmatic, notably utilising SQL as a fundamental, but with either Python, R or Julia in support and some data visualisation work with Tableau too. Initially you will be mainly doing hands-on analysis work, but as you develop and grow you will be able to get in front of clients and drive the insight first-hand too. The team you will be joining is made up of mainly PhD graduates from top-tier Universities. This is reflected within the senior leadership too. But they&apos;re not just brilliant minds, they&apos;re all commercially grounded too, understanding the implications of suggested actions from data and able to demonstrate commercial benefit to a business too. As such they&apos;re really keen to engage someone similar, who&apos;s keen to learn still and embed themselves in the data science field, learning the programmatic side whilst being able to balance the commercial reasoning too. If this sounds like a role that aligns with your qualifications and future aspirations then please feel free to apply and get in touch! Role: Data Scientist - Data Analyst Location: London Salary: ?35,000-?45,000 KEY EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: - Recent graduate (if PhD) or someone with a couple of years commercial experience within the Data Science field - Must hold a numerate degree in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance.

<ns1:description>Are you an experienced Data Visualisation specialist wanting to get into a career within Data Science for a really innovative start-up business that&apos;s backed by a well-known blue-chip?If so I may have the ideal role for you! The role: You&apos;re going to be joining a small team of data scientists in a role which helps the business understand its data and see what&apos;s happening, where, how and what action should be taken off the back of it. Helping to define business KPI&apos;s, talking to business stakeholders, finding out what people need to know and helping to shape the data visualisation and reporting to suit. You get how to structure data and make things work, not too techie, but you&apos;re personable and get the business side of things too, and what&apos;s important when developing data visualisation dashboards which can help tell the story behind the data. But beyond that, you&apos;ve got an interest in wanting to get exposure to data science yourself too, and for the future would be interested in developing your career down that kind of path. You like to feel valued and be a member of a small, but influential team - and love the opportunity to shape something that&apos;s new and make it really special. The business: This is an innovative business based in what is a feature building, in London. It&apos;s the home to a business that is household name and some extremely exciting stakeholders. They promises to be something very different in the loyalty space and the first time this business, which are largely separately owned organisations, are joining forces to reward customers for their brand advocacy. i.e. the more someone interacts and engages with the separate sectors of the business, the more rewards they will receive. It&apos;s a gamified platform, launched on iPhone and Android devices and is looking to offer a truly unique experience to customers. This will include some pretty major once-in-a-lifetime opportunities and things you don&apos;t see in other loyalty based offerings. The business you will be joining is a start-up. There&apos;s just over 10 people in the business right now so you&apos;re getting in on the ground level. Funding is currently provided by a large corporate company and they&apos;ve achieved approval for second round. This has enabled the beta &apos;go live&apos; and they&apos;re going to be looking to scale operations as the customer base grows and the product completes its beta testing. There&apos;s a few things which are unique about the business too - it&apos;s not a corporate environment and they look carefully to ensure there&apos;s something unique about you when you meet with them. What that means in reality is they like interesting people. People with character and strong positive interests. A want to make a difference in the work you do and the enjoyment you get out of life itself. Everyone there has a passion outside of work, they see that as important - be it rock climbing, singing in a rock band, or just being a massive gadget geek. It&apos;s all good and embraced - people&apos;s differences bring different ideas and ways of working. That&apos;s something they&apos;re big on. This is an entrepreneurial environment though, being a start-up, so it&apos;s important you&apos;re able to muck-in as much as possible and love the idea of being able to be part of something which promises to be truly great. Role details: Role: Data Visualisation Analyst Location: London Salary: ?35,000 - ?45,000 Benefits: To be confirmed KEY EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: - Experienced using SQL and Tableau, ClickView or ClickFox - 1-2 year&apos;s commercial experience - In-depth knowledge of creating customer insight driven dashboards with real-time data that can be easily interpreted by stakeholders - Ambition and drive to commit and develop in one company - You need to be able to work collaboratively to implement change - Experience in implementing gamification dynamics to a digital community based platform - Be able to communicate and engage the business when providing key insights around performance and data analysis - Have enthusiasm about a fast-evolving telecommunications industry - Degree level or equivalent For further information please contact: Maddie Tait Associate Consultant - Blue Pelican Marketing You can view all our vacancies on our web site , or call and ask for the marketing division.</ns1:description>

You’re logical, analytical and have strong data mining, manipulation and reporting skills. If you have any experience of using a data mining and statistical software tool such as SPSS Modeler or an integrated customer analytics and marketing automation system such as BlueVenn, then even better!

Today we follow a similar purpose, helping people to protect and provide for the things they love, although on a much larger scale and through a wide range of financial services including insurance, investment and retirement products. Our goal of growing member value is underpinned by our vision: to be Britain’s best loved insurer. We believe that developing products of benefit for our customers and offering a high quality of service will translate into enhanced profitability for our members.

<ns1:description>Analytical graduate with some Javascript or Jquery - Web analyst If you are an analytical graduate with some coding skills, I have a trainee website analysis role with an amazing agency.. fantastic training.. Perhaps you find the online world very exciting but don’t know how to engage with it, perhaps you have played with Google Analytics.. I think my client would be interested in meeting you.. My client is one of the UK&apos;s leading website analytics companies.. And they like to find Economics or Maths graduates with an interest or passion for the web. Ideally they like to see candidates with some coding experience such as HTML or Javascript.. This is not essential but would be a massive advantage My client is a very geeky analytics consultancy that have grown through developing their own talent. Initially they tried to find candidates with a &quot;ready made skills set&quot; of web analytics, javascript, html, web analysis tools such as coremetrics, Google Analytics, but they quickly realised that these people are far too expensive and that &quot;old dogs and new tricks&quot; don’t mix.. They quickly found fresh ideas and new imaginative ideas come from new fresh imaginative minds.. So they want to find Maths and Economics grads who DON’T want to be accountants or FX traders.. On a daily basis, you&apos;ll be working with client Websites analysing user journey&apos;s, measuring bounce rates, defining Google Analytics goals to measure events, measuring traffic flows, measuring individual user journeys against site destinations.. Do you get the picture? Are excited by the description.. If you do, please make contact with me, Trevor Jones Goodchildsmith Digital Recruitment</ns1:description>

<ns1:jobTitle>Recruitment Consultant - &lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt; / Customer Data / Insight</ns1:jobTitle>
<ns1:description>CVM People are looking to take on a Recruitment Consultant to grow the our already impressive showing within the analytics, insight and customer data space. We currently work with organisations like Vodafone, Lloyds, Centrica, and John Lewis to provide anything from specialist consultancy to board level appointments to whole teams of insight or campaign analysts. We know our chosen market extremely well and have cultivated an exceptional reputation among our clients, as we expand we are looking for a Recruitment Consultant, or possibly two!) with either an already established history of delivering into the analytics space, or a strong interest in moving into it. What are we looking for? 1. Passion - it sounds cliche, but it&apos;s true. We&apos;ve been doing this for long enough to know that if you don&apos;t love what you do, if you can&apos;t bring excitement and energy to it, it just won&apos;t work! 2. Commitment - Another one...OK, let&apos;s just get all these out the way, and drive, and determination, and a desire to learn, and for you to be a self starter, and all the other stuff you see on every recruitment spec. We want all that - obviously (if you come in here and tell us that you&apos;re utterly dead inside, terrified of commiting to a task, won&apos;t remember to breathe without instruction, and feel you&apos;ve already learned everything there is to know and can&apos;t possibly manage any more, it&apos;s going to be a pretty short interview!) -but we also want... 3. Expertise - We pride ourselves on being subject matter experts, on being the go-to people for our clients to solve specific problems. We want someone who takes pride in the same thing as we do, not an opportunist scatter-gunning their way through LinkedIn filling a .NET dev here and a CCVP engineer there, but someone who is, or wants to become, a true specialist! 4. Fun - We&apos;re a small company, in a small office - our attitudes and moods effect each other and we strive to make sure that is always a positive. Everyone is entitled to a bad day, but being able to keep the mood high, join in with the jokes, and enjoy time with your colleagues is hugely important! 5. Collaboration - It&apos;s a mature environment here, there&apos;s no sneaking behind each other&apos;s backs, and everyone will pitch in with knowledge and contacts to help each other out. Transparency and honesty with colleagues, and cooperation to ensure success, is part of our culture. What are we offering? Earning potential A good base salary and strong commission scheme, sure, but also a huge network to tap into, built through practitions not recruiters - strong, director level relationships that can be cultivated into valuable relationships and opportunities. Training &amp; Resources All of our consultants are put through the Social Talent Sourcing Ninja training as standard, on top of this you will have access to exceptional sources of hands on industry knowledge to help you really understand the area you work in. A Warm Welcome So you want to build a desk in your chosen niche, great! We&apos;ll support you to do that and give you the tools to make you as successful as you want to be. However, you also need to pay the bills - so we&apos;ll also make sure you get live roles to work from day one! For more information, and a confidential discussion - apply now!</ns1:description>
