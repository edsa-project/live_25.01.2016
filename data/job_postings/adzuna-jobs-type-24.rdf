Working with, and in support of, key stakeholders ultimately you will assist in developing processes and procedures ensuring clinical IMP availability which will be achieved by accurate forecasting, scheduling, operational coordination and risk management. You will have the ability to work with cross-functional teams for study management activities and to ensure regulatory compliance. Internal contacts will include Project Management colleagues while externally they will include CROs, IVR/IWR providers, client clinical supply teams and client clinical operations teams.  This is a very fast-paced role that requires excellent communication skills and the ability to work with initiative under pressure.      Benefits - Highly competitive salary to ?35,000 - Full training in Clinical Trial Supply Chains based on clinical trial expertise - Structured career path  - Contributory pension scheme - Bonus scheme - Private health cover - Full home office support Experience The successful candidate will have a full understanding of clinical trial processes, procedures, clinical significance and regulatory standards. You could have gained your expertise working as a Clinical Trial Administrator, Clinical Trial Coordinator, Clinical Research Associate, Data Management, IVRS Project Coordination, Clinical Supplies or other role with broad clinical trial exposure. This experience could have been gained in either a pharmaceutical / sponsor or service provider environment.    Please note this is NOT a graduate trainee opportunity as we require clinical trial experience gained in a commercial workplace environment. Also you will require your own transport due to the company location just outside of Horsham as no public transport is available.  Keywords:  Clinical Trial Administrator, Clinical Trial Associate, Clinical Research Associate, Data Management, Clinical Trial Coordinator, IVRS Project Coordination, IVRS Project Manager, Supply Chain Manager, Senior Project Manager, Global Project Manager, PRINCE2, Customer Services, Account Manager, Supply Chain, Logistics, Distribution, Project Management, GCP, GMP, GDP, CTS, Clinical Supply, Clinical Trial Supply, CRO, Clinical Supplies, Clinical Trial Supplies,  IVRS, IWRS, IRT, IxRS    This is a permanent position.   Contact: Pharma Jobs Reference: Totaljobs/14363 BT Job ID: 63977059</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>About the role You’ll be joining our award winning Direct Marketing Department and more specifically, the Analytics team, as a Marketing MI Analyst. This team are specialists in data mining, manipulation and analysis and support the delivery of our General Insurance Marketing Campaigns, by providing valuable insight and recommendations which assist in future marketing decisions and activity. Day to day you’ll maintain the integrity of our customer marketing data, data models and member profiles, ensuring it’s used for the correct intent and purposes and the data output is accurate. You’ll undertake marketing campaign analysis to determine the effectiveness of marketing activity performance versus plan. You’ll drill down into customer segments, channel performance and sales; identifying any key trends, insight and shortfalls to provide recommendations based on your results and analysis which contribute to the future development of marketing campaigns and proposed changes. Lastly, you’ll create and deliver regular and ad-hoc Marketing MI reporting which is suitable and understandable to a non-analytical audience. And with the Ad-hoc requests, this means you have the freedom to delve into new things. We’ll also expect you to be proactive in identifying gaps in the current reporting, making suggestions for improvement. About you Ideally you have experience or are working in a similar analytical or MI role at the moment, preferably within Marketing, however if not, then don’t worry. What’s most important to us is your analytical, statistical or data background, coupled with the right motivation, drive and passion to pick things up quickly. You’re logical, analytical and have strong data mining, manipulation and reporting skills. If you have any experience of using a data mining and statistical software tool such as SPSS Modeler or an integrated customer analytics and marketing automation system such as BlueVenn, then even better! Likewise, you have strong Excel and reporting skills and in particular, visual basic macro. You have excellent attention to detail and take pride in the accuracy and output of your work. You work well individually and like being part of a wider team to achieve a common goal. You like to keep a close eye on the market, taking note of any new analytics trends that keep us ahead of the competition and achieve the best results for our customers and members. About the rewards This role is a Band B in the LV= Structure. We want you to love what you do. That’s why we’ve put together a benefits package that recognises and rewards a job well done. We’ll give you: a competitive pension an annual bonus scheme 26 days&apos; holiday a flexible benefits package (eg: dental insurance, childcare vouchers, retail vouchers) and a generous 25% discount off our general insurance products including home and car, and up to 12% off our life products Here at LV= we always love to hear from great people, so don’t forget to follow us on Twitter, LinkedIn and become a fan on Facebook. We’re also proud to say we’re an equal opportunities employer. About us LV= employs over 6000 people and serves over 5.5 million customers with a range of financial products. We are the UK’s largest friendly society and a leading financial mutual. When we started in 1843 our goal was to give financial security to more than just a privileged few and for many decades we were most commonly associated with providing a method of saving to people of modest means. Today we follow a similar purpose, helping people to protect and provide for the things they love, although on a much larger scale and through a wide range of financial services including insurance, investment and retirement products. Our goal of growing member value is underpinned by our vision: to be Britain’s best loved insurer. We believe that developing products of benefit for our customers and offering a high quality of service will translate into enhanced profitability for our members. We approach business in a way that combines the trusted behaviours of a mutual with the competitiveness you would expect from a successful plc. Our employees are core to our business and we have created a positive, motivated workforce to ensure they offer the best possible service to our members and customers. We call this being &apos;sharp with a heart’.</ns1:description>
