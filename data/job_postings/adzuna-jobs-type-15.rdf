<ns1:description>Infrastructure Technology Costing Lead - Investment Banking Location: London Salary: circa ?75-110K + benefits + bonus A leading Global Investment Bank are looking to hire an Infrastructure Technology Cost Transparency Lead within the Technology Business Management team. The lead will manage and map out costs of technology infrastructure across multiple business areas in line with the strategy of the business and their associated technology needs. The lead therefore will look to put controls in place for different scenarios and the impact this could have on the business streams, for example what happens when there is increasing spending on applications or lowering technology costs in certain elements of hardware etc. Ideal Skills/Experience: Should have a good technology appreciation in big enterprise environments and be able to talk about technology with senior management / business stakeholders (potentially from another investment bank but equally something like Oil&amp;Gas / Financial Services etc). Comfortable at working with Enterprise Finances / Cost Allocation and mapping out costings short/long term - good data analysis with a bigger picture focus perspective. Someone from a Technology Business Management or Infrastructure Service Delivery background would work well as long as they have good costing allocation appreciation - any associated tools such as Apptio / IT Business Management Tools. Ability to face off to senior business stakeholders to translate the costs / strategy. Ability to face off to the infrastructure services teams (eg applications, networks, servers etc) Banking experience is desirable, but as long as you come from a large complex enterprise company e.g. Oil/Gas company, large law firm etc. This role would give the individual potentially from a Technology/Infrastructure background who is business savvy and business facing in nature. This individual will get fantastic business exposure and therefore is an opportunity to grow their career with a clear path towards Director level within a leading global investment bank.
