What you’ll be doing - As Database Administrator you will provide technical support and expertise on a range of gaming and business database platforms including but not limited to; DB2, SQL Server, MySQL and Sybase IQ.

This includes; configuration, installation, patching and upgrading.

Must be keen and willing to pick up new systems and very much a self-starter in your approach to work Aside from the opportunity to work with a great team, we are offering a competitive salary, bonus and benefits package. If you are an experienced DBA and feel that you meet the above criteria then we want to hear from you!</ns1:description>
