This will be working with both the Programme Manager and Technical Development Manager on a ?5million programme to ensure that their roll-out is successfully delivered in line with their aggressive delivery time-frame. With the backing of a large venture-capitalist firm this is a unique programme that is moving at an extremely fast-pace and would suit someone who is well versed when it comes to working across medium-sized Retail/ERP Programmes of business change.This is an opportunity to ultimately hold a large amount of technical influence across a unique retail implementation as you will be working with the Business Heads and also the onsite M/S Gold Partner. The SQL DBA must possess strong Production experience, SQL Performance Tuning knowledge and must have worked previously with relational database management systems. The right candidate will come from a strong retail and online commerce background as alot of the database information they are working with is linked to online transactions and user interaction. With relevant ERP knowledge they must not necessarily have AX2012 experience but must have worked on relevant ERP implementations with either the SAP, Oracle or JD Edwards solutions. Due to the demanding nature of the programme there will also be a need to support the roll-out during out of hours so the right person will be prepared to do this on the odd occassion as and when needed. This will be a two-stage interview process for someone to start ASAP.

They are making some serious waves within the industry and have some key players on their side, making this a really, really exciting time to join a company that is doing incredibly well but, is still in it&apos;s infancy with Greenfield work and no red tape. You could be a osftware developer with a C#, C++ or Java background with any relational database such as SQL, Oracle or Sybase are welcome as they are looking to build their systems using GoLang - Google&apos;s language meaning this is also a fantastic time for a tech agnostic developer to add some new technologies to the tool kit! You would not need to be an algorithmic, low latency developer currently, as they looking to build the entire systems, so think of this as being an all-seeing, all-doing role with exposure to all aspects of the system.

If you are really passionate developer/programmer/engineer that is really interested in cutting edge technology you would fit in really well here, as technology really is the driver for them however, they are filling the void left by slower, less dynamic Investment Bank&apos;s within this high frequency trading world, and are already taking the 3rd tier competition by storm - making this a really interesting business proposition as well. Please apply with an updated CV if you are interested.</ns1:description>

I am working an extremely successful professional services company that are spear-heading their development team for future growth! They are doing this by growing their development team and completely modernising the technologies they use. To be successful in this role you must have commercial experience using ASP.net, MVC and currently code in C#. You will be skilled with databases and web services, in particular with SQL Server 2008, 2012 or 2014. All of their developers are responsible for taking each system and product through the full software development lifecycle, so experience of the full SDLC and taking requirements, working with end users etc would be an advantage, as would experience of working to Agile development methodologies. Finally, the use of of front-end technologies and mobile development in your past will be an advantage (although is not essential) especially commercial use of Javascript, Bootstrap and jQuery, as they have some greenfield project work in this area later in the year. Don&apos;t miss the fantastic opportunity to join a growing business who pride themselves on being a great place to work. Employees are offered very flexible working conditions (e.g. flexitime, remote working etc), a fun and relaxed working environment and lots of autonomy within the role. For more information please do not delay in sending me your up to date CV. You can also call Luke Walters for more information on 0161 817 7888.</ns1:description>

The BI manager must have experience of: -&gt; leading teams of BI &amp; database developers -&gt; growing / recruiting additional technical staff -&gt; managing technical projects and product implementations across the full project life-cycle -&gt; managing senior stakeholders and customer/client relationships For more information please contact Hemant Sabharwal on 0161 817 7888 and/or submit a current CV as soon as possible.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>SQL Development Manager (Hands off)- Warrington - Great Benefits! An excellent SQL Development management is required to join a leading financial business within the Warrington area. This role is to manage a small team of SQL developers, and would be a balance of project management, people management, resource management and solution shaping. The ideal candidate will come from a development background and will have strong T-SQL experience, but will have spent recent positions employed as a team lead or team manager. Above all, excellent communication skills are a must &amp; the right person for this job will be well organised and a real team-player. The successful candidate must be able to demonstrate experience of: - leading teams of SQL Server professionals - mentoring and up-skilling junior and other less experienced developers - solid technical knowledge of SQL Server including: * T-SQL * SSIS / ETL / DTS / SQL Server Integration Services * SQL database objects (e.g. stored procedures, triggers, views, functions etc) * Project management * People management * Resource management * Solution shaping The development managers&apos; workload will be a balance of man-management, project planning and technical, hands-on development with a focus on man-management aspect but the plan is to move the manager away from SQL development as soon as possible.
