<ns1:description>Our client is one of the success stories of recent years and has trebled in size since 2013. They are still in a significant growth phase and will double in size again within the next three years. Having invested significant sums in their data and customer insights team they are now looking for someone to head up Customer Insights.  The business is famous for its culture - one which is truly people driven and where progression is driven by ability and the inspirational leadership team. You will be responsible for disseminating the information to the commercial and finance teams and providing true customer insight. The role is pretty much a &apos;black sheet of paper&apos; and you must have a commercial head.  You will probably be a member of a larger organisation and want to have overall responsibility for strategy of a department. You will relish the accountability and responsibility of the role and will be capable of working with the executive team and many stakeholders both internal and external. Your ability to communicate and to make &apos;big data&apos; relevant to the business and individuals will be unparalleled. Opportunities to join this business at this level do not occur that often due to their incredibly successful internal development, so if this sounds of interest please get in touch. Interviews will be held locally, and only successful candidates may be contacted. Contact: Daniel Cornwell Reference: Totaljobs/SPE/R/003065 Job ID: 64016682</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Bi/ Data warehouse Developer (FULL MSBI STACK) Team Lead, greenfield project It&apos;s always an exciting opportunity to work in a cutting-edge and technically forward organisation, but even more than that to make your mark on developing their systems from scratch, setting up an entire new Data Warehouse/ Business Intelligence function and making your mark on growing up a Business Intelligence function from the ground up. It also takes a specific type of person, who has the technical abilities and talent of course but someone who lives and breathes data and BI, understanding what an organisation needs to implement in order to achieve the highest standards and meet the ambitious organisational goals. Naturally, this team are looking for an equally ambitious and driven Business Intelligence (BI)/ Data Warehouse Developer who can lead the team in achieving this! So a little about the company, they are covering huge amounts of data within the Healthcare and Financial industry making possibly one of the biggest impacts on the U.K. Whilst being completely hands on, you will be the most Senior on the team reporting into the &quot; BI Solutions Manager&quot;. You will act as a Subject matter except in delivering the BI solutions and platforms (SSIS, SSRS, SSAS). As it stands, they have a DWH in place, which they will be integrating all the data over into the new Data Warehouse and building up the new Business Intelligence functions. You will be working with a large team of roughly 50 people that cover MIS (DBA&apos;s, Data/ BI Analysts, Data Architects, Operations, Development team, APP Dev and support, PM&apos;s/ BA&apos;s and testing.) broken up into 4 team covering Data and Analytics. Although you will be immediately working with 10 people in your immediate team you will work across the board in a collaborative nature. Therefore, experience working in a team environment is essentially understanding and being apart of an entire end to end process in a software development Life-cycle. In terms of reporting, arguably one of the most importunate functions for this organisation in which they are using SSRS on the back end, and Tableau as a neat visualisation tool to represent the complex analysis of large data sets. In terms of Tableau, we realise that this is rather similar to various visualisation reporting tools such as Qlikview. We are looking for someone who has worked with reporting tools such as Tableau, Qlikview etc. who can also translate reporting conclusion to non technical users. So, to some this all up… We are looking for a Data Warehouse/ BI Developer Team Lead who will have: Extensive experience using SQL Server (2008 R2 and 2014) and strong T-SQL Previous experience Designing/ Developing a Data Warehouse from scratch (enterprise DWH is a bonus!) Experience Developing the ETL process for large data sets, developing the SSIS packages Experience developing reporting functions from scratch - SSRS Experience with visualisation reporting tools (Tableau is preferred) / Qlikview etc. Experience building SSAS OLAP cubes Working within a team environment of 5 people + (if you were a Team Lead/ Mentor that is a massive plus!) Knowledge of application lifecycle management Acting as a subject matter for BI ability to translate complex technical requirements to technical/ non technical Excellent stakeholder management experience - ability to influence important business decisions and communicate with all avenues of the business Working in an AGILE environment (and IDEALLY Waterfall too) understanding the advantages of each and able to compare/ transfer knowledge of both methodologies (SCRUM/XP/Kanban) Knowledge/ experience of Test group development and testing lifecycle Experience in managing releases and builds using version control system (TFS), in a DEV/UAT/Production environment What we will be very impressed with (ALTHOUGH NOT ESSENTIAL) Experience developing enterprise Data Warehouses MDX Experience with BIML Experience with Big Data Application development experience (.Net, C#, MVC etc) Microsoft APS (analytics Platform System) Please contact me if you think you could be a good fit, I would LOVE to tell you more about this company and the projects that they are doing send your CV to shannin.mccauley@fpit.co.uk (01189585507) No terminology in this advert is designed to discriminate on grounds of gender, race, colour, religion, creed, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation.

<ns1:description>Full Stack Web Developer (Solid exp in Back-end development) - Join this award winning dot.com in Asia. Bangkok, Thailand! Full relocation and visa sponsorship available! Java, C#, cassandra, ElasticSearch, Hadoop Junior (2 years+ - Senior Architects welcome to apply) - I am looking for 6-10 engineers to join this department. My Client: My client is one of the leading technology companies, not only in the industry but the world. At no point do they wish to be limited by the technology. As such, the right candidate will be exposed to numerous innovative technologies (including, but not limited to, big data, NOSQL). Cutting edge projects around personalization, machine learning, natural language processing. You will also be exposed to creating scalable infrastructure and architecture ensuring products can go from a few thousand calls per second to tens of thousands without any downtime or degradation in customer experience. The Role: My client is looking for engineering experts to ensure their website is the best of its kind in the world. This role is twofold, but for both you will be a technical expert. Primarily show real strength in back-end engineering. You will have real prowess in programming, architecture, scalability, distributed technologies. An in-depth understanding of TCP/IP, HTTP and how the web works will be crucial. Expertise in distributed platforms here will be a major plus (examples, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, Hadoop, CouchDB etc). They would expect back-end role experience of some key projects, ability to explain and justify your architecture. Attention to server side performance, measurements, big data analysis will also be a significant part of this role. Secondly, they would expect superb attention to detail of the performance of the web site on the browser. Familiarity and expertise in the latest technologies will be required. It is not enough to have a high-performing back-end but they absolutely must ensure the user has the best experience available. You will need to understand how the browser interprets the html, css, DOM etc. to produce pages that any user on any device will be able to interact and enjoy as soon as is possible. Ultimately Big Wednesday are looking for real technologists who have a great passion for creating robust, scalable and reliable architectures to support a fantastic end product. We want persons with innovative ideas on how to ensure that the customer is saved that last 100 milliseconds, so they can process TB&apos;s of data in minutes, or how to architect the server side to support tens of thousands of requests a second. What&apos;s in it for you? If successful you will receive good exposure to the business side, and be able to see and measure the true value of the work. Nothing is opaque at my client. They work in agile which for them does mean really focusing on business value as well as technological aptitude. Despite the success and size of the company they really operate with a start-up feel; you get to be part of choosing where and what you&apos;re working on, the technologies and how they solve the business concerns. Skill &amp; Experience Requirements: Technologies of interest (we are not expecting you to have them all) : Java (or other JVM languages), C# is acceptable Solid experience with UNIX shell scripts and O/S Node.js Cassandra / ElasticSearch / Hadoop Knockout.js, Angular.js, Gulp.js LESS, SASS Memcached, Redis Postgres, SQL Server, MySql Experience 2+ years experience min in a full stack role (we are also very keen to hear from senior developers up to Architects as we have 6 open roles) Good standard of English both written and spoken Please note this role is open to both Thai and International candidates.

<ns1:description>Full Stack Web Developer (Solid exp in Back-end development) - Join this award winning dot.com in Asia. Position is based in Bangkok, Thailand! Full relocation and visa sponsorship available! Java, C#, cassandra, ElasticSearch, Hadoop Junior (2 years+ - Senior Architects welcome to apply) - I am looking for 6-10 engineers to join this department. My Client: My client is one of the leading technology companies, not only in the industry but the world. At no point do they wish to be limited by the technology. As such, the right candidate will be exposed to numerous innovative technologies (including, but not limited to, big data, NOSQL). Cutting edge projects around personalization, machine learning, natural language processing. You will also be exposed to creating scalable infrastructure and architecture ensuring products can go from a few thousand calls per second to tens of thousands without any downtime or degradation in customer experience. The Role: My client is looking for engineering experts to ensure their website is the best of its kind in the world. This role is twofold, but for both you will be a technical expert. Primarily show real strength in back-end engineering. You will have real prowess in programming, architecture, scalability, distributed technologies. An in-depth understanding of TCP/IP, HTTP and how the web works will be crucial. Expertise in distributed platforms here will be a major plus (examples, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, Hadoop, CouchDB etc). They would expect back-end role experience of some key projects, ability to explain and justify your architecture. Attention to server side performance, measurements, big data analysis will also be a significant part of this role. Secondly, they would expect superb attention to detail of the performance of the web site on the browser. Familiarity and expertise in the latest technologies will be required. It is not enough to have a high-performing back-end but they absolutely must ensure the user has the best experience available. You will need to understand how the browser interprets the html, css, DOM etc. to produce pages that any user on any device will be able to interact and enjoy as soon as is possible. Ultimately Big Wednesday are looking for real technologists who have a great passion for creating robust, scalable and reliable architectures to support a fantastic end product. We want persons with innovative ideas on how to ensure that the customer is saved that last 100 milliseconds, so they can process TB&apos;s of data in minutes, or how to architect the server side to support tens of thousands of requests a second. What&apos;s in it for you? If successful you will receive good exposure to the business side, and be able to see and measure the true value of the work. Nothing is opaque at my client. They work in agile which for them does mean really focusing on business value as well as technological aptitude. Despite the success and size of the company they really operate with a start-up feel; you get to be part of choosing where and what you&apos;re working on, the technologies and how they solve the business concerns. Skill &amp; Experience Requirements: Technologies of interest (we are not expecting you to have them all) : Java (or other JVM languages), C# is acceptable Solid experience with UNIX shell scripts and O/S Node.js Cassandra / ElasticSearch / Hadoop Knockout.js, Angular.js, Gulp.js LESS, SASS Memcached, Redis Postgres, SQL Server, MySql Experience 2+ years experience min in a full stack role (we are also very keen to hear from senior developers up to Architects as we have 6 open roles) Good standard of English both written and spoken Please note this role is open to both Thai and International candidates.

<ns1:description>Account Executive Beaconsfield Core2Store is a leading shopper marketing company with established blue chip clients. Our client base is increasing and we need more staff. The Account Executive acts as a link between clients and the agency. You would be responsible for the coordination of campaigns and liaising clearly and confidently to all those involved. The role involves handling multiple accounts working for an Account Director. The Account Executive will need to be able to communicate very effectively on the phone, on paper/electronically and face to face. The Account Executive will need to be well organised, work well within, and contribute to, a team. The Account Executive will work in a data rich environment, as Core2Store is very advanced in the use of Big Data to drive customer shopper marketing initiatives. In this role you will need to demonstrate a good knowledge of Excel, database experience in the past would also be an asset. Naturally demonstrating an ability to manage detail, while keeping your eye on the objective, is absolutely paramount. The Account Executive will need to understand clients&apos; needs and objectives and liaise closely with them throughout campaigns, often on a daily basis. The ability to listen as well as talk (possibly also instead of talking) is invariably an asset. You will be responsible for administrative and campaign work to ensure that media and store based projects are completed on time and on budget. The Account Executive in this position will love this job: If you flourish under pressure, delivering solutions, while working in a team environment where your input is valued. If you want to work in a leading edge marketing environment. The Account Executive will hate this job: If you have issues with managing details under pressure, and losing track of objectives when the going gets tougher. The Account Executive will need a good degree level education and the right person could expect to progress fast.  The job is based in our Beaconsfield office, very close to the M40 and London.

<ns1:description>Have you recently completed your PhD or MSc in a numerate subject matter from a top-tier University, and are you looking to get into the exciting world of Data Science? If doing this for an established Consultancy within the Financial Services sector appeals, read on! The business is part of a very large, multi-national corporate brand. But are innovative, agile and entrepreneurial. They have to be, since they&apos;re a consultancy who carry out projects on behalf of a wide array of external clients. You will be joining a team of 4, within a wider division of 30. The work you will be taking on will offer variety and the chance to learn so much because of the kinds of projects you will undertake for end clients. For example, you could be working on a range of optimisation or propensity models, working across a portfolio of financial products and services. You could also be working across behavioural economics, notably linking behavioural analytics to economics. This is an exciting opportunity for a recent graduate who has the relevant qualifications in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance with significant exposure to quantitative analytics and a good basis within computational programming utilising a recognised analysis/modelling tool. This is a Big Data environment and it&apos;s expected you will be comfortable taking on a role that&apos;s got a lot of emphasis on programmatic, notably utilising SQL as a fundamental, but with either Python, R or Julia in support and some data visualisation work with Tableau too. Initially you will be mainly doing hands-on analysis work, but as you develop and grow you will be able to get in front of clients and drive the insight first-hand too. The team you will be joining is made up of mainly PhD graduates from top-tier Universities. This is reflected within the senior leadership too. But they&apos;re not just brilliant minds, they&apos;re all commercially grounded too, understanding the implications of suggested actions from data and able to demonstrate commercial benefit to a business too. As such they&apos;re really keen to engage someone similar, who&apos;s keen to learn still and embed themselves in the data science field, learning the programmatic side whilst being able to balance the commercial reasoning too. If this sounds like a role that aligns with your qualifications and future aspirations then please feel free to apply and get in touch! Role: Data Scientist - Data Analyst Location: London Salary: ?35,000-?45,000 KEY EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: - Recent graduate (if PhD) or someone with a couple of years commercial experience within the Data Science field - Must hold a numerate degree in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance.
