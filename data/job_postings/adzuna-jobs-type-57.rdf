<ns1:description>My client, a leading City of London based insurance firm, are looking to hire an Assistant Management Accountant. The job has arisen due to my client&apos;s excellent growth over the last 2 years. My client has a preference for candidates pursuing an accountancy qualification, i.e. ACCA or CIMA. The role is incredibly progressive and my client is looking for &quot;future leaders of the business&quot;. My client has a preference for candidates with a good level of finance experience within the insurance sector. The duties include assisting with variance analysis, budgeting and forecasting, accruals and prepayments, month end intercompany reconciliations, VAT returns, sales forecasting, analysing revenue streams and processing sales invoices. My client has a preference for candidates who have been exposed to accounting for multiple entities (multicurrency exposure is a bonus too). Candidates with a good level of finance experience within the insurance sector are extremely desirable. Applicants should have a good level of Excel, i.e. be comfortable building pivot tables and v-look ups from scratch. Candidates should be pursuing their ACCA or CIMA qualification. The role is incredibly progressive and the sky is the limit for candidates who show the right level of attitude and competence. The offices are based in a vibrant area of London in close proximity to restaurants, cafes and parks.</ns1:description>
