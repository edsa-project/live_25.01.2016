<ns1:description>If you&apos;re an aspiring accountant looking for a role that will challenge you and go hand-in-hand with your professional development, then this is a fantastic opportunity for you!

About the Role: Reporting to the Management Accountant and providing first line analysis on the monthly management accounts. Preparation of monthly management accounts, including journal entry, budgeting, forecasting, and reconciliation of balance sheets. Accruals and prepayments. Statutory audits and compliance duties.

<ns1:description>Have you recently completed your PhD or MSc in a numerate subject matter from a top-tier University, and are you looking to get into the exciting world of Data Science? If doing this for an established Consultancy within the Financial Services sector appeals, read on! The business is part of a very large, multi-national corporate brand. But are innovative, agile and entrepreneurial. They have to be, since they&apos;re a consultancy who carry out projects on behalf of a wide array of external clients. You will be joining a team of 4, within a wider division of 30. The work you will be taking on will offer variety and the chance to learn so much because of the kinds of projects you will undertake for end clients. For example, you could be working on a range of optimisation or propensity models, working across a portfolio of financial products and services. You could also be working across behavioural economics, notably linking behavioural analytics to economics. This is an exciting opportunity for a recent graduate who has the relevant qualifications in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance with significant exposure to quantitative analytics and a good basis within computational programming utilising a recognised analysis/modelling tool. This is a Big Data environment and it&apos;s expected you will be comfortable taking on a role that&apos;s got a lot of emphasis on programmatic, notably utilising SQL as a fundamental, but with either Python, R or Julia in support and some data visualisation work with Tableau too. Initially you will be mainly doing hands-on analysis work, but as you develop and grow you will be able to get in front of clients and drive the insight first-hand too. The team you will be joining is made up of mainly PhD graduates from top-tier Universities. This is reflected within the senior leadership too. But they&apos;re not just brilliant minds, they&apos;re all commercially grounded too, understanding the implications of suggested actions from data and able to demonstrate commercial benefit to a business too. As such they&apos;re really keen to engage someone similar, who&apos;s keen to learn still and embed themselves in the data science field, learning the programmatic side whilst being able to balance the commercial reasoning too. If this sounds like a role that aligns with your qualifications and future aspirations then please feel free to apply and get in touch! Role: Data Scientist - Data Analyst Location: London Salary: ?35,000-?45,000 KEY EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: - Recent graduate (if PhD) or someone with a couple of years commercial experience within the Data Science field - Must hold a numerate degree in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance. MSc or PhD is a big advantage - Essential experience using SQL and one of the following: R, Python, Julia, SAS or SPSS - Knowledge of database skills - programming, manipulations, handling and mining. - Experience in statistical, quantitative analysis and notably modelling - You need to be able to work collaboratively to implement change - Be able to communicate and engage the business when providing key insights around performance and data analysis - Have enthusiasm about a fast-evolving consultancy For further information please contact: Maddie Tait Associate Consultant - Blue Pelican Marketing You can view all our vacancies on our web site , or call and ask for the marketing division.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Programme Manager - Banking Technology Vendor Salary: circa ?90-100K + benefits + strong bonus Location: London A leading banking and finance technology consultancy/vendor are looking to hire a Programme Manager within their Trade Finance / Banking Transaction Technology business stream to face off to banking &amp; finance clients, understanding their needs and ensure effective project scoping and other associated presales activities. The Programme Manager will lead a team of Project Managers who have a range of technical and business resources across Europe and ensure effective delivery of solutions and projects for clients once they are effectively scoped out and solution designed. They already have a number of big programmes and projects in the pipeline with major financial and banking clients so this is a very exciting time for the Programme Manager to join. A background in Banking Transaction/Trade Finance is desirable but not essential, the most important thing is strong project management skills, ability to face off to clients (pre sales type work), scope out necessary project work and to lead resources to deliver effective solutions. With this in mind it is an ideal role for a Programme Manager who is looking for a new challenge and enjoys getting a lot of exposure both on the business and technical side and will be a driving force behind delivery. This role is predominately London based but please note as the PM will have a team of Project Managers across Europe they may have some travel but can be quite limited dependent on the preference of the individual as the major clients are in London. Ideal Skills/Experience: Strong Project Management capability, in particular for Project Scoping and understanding the needs of a client/business and ability to design effective solution. Any knowledge of Trade Finance / Banking Transactions is ideal, general finance/banking knowledge would also be desirable. Good leadership skills, ability to lead project managers and multiple projects across a number of international locations. Experience in a Software / Banking Vendor or Consultancy environment in client facing role Ability to face off to Business and Technical stakeholders both internally and externally.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Programme Manager - Financial Software House Salary: circa ?90-100K + benefits + strong bonus potential Location: London A leading banking and financial software house / banking technology vendor are looking to hire a Programme Manager within their Banking Technology business stream to face off to Banking clients, understanding their needs and ensure effective project scoping and other associated presales activities. The specific business stream is Trade Finance / Transaction Banking but prior knowledge of this area is not necessary as long as the individual has experience in facing off to clients, scoping requirements and programme delivery, ideally coming from a Software House / Vendor / Consultancy background. The Programme Manager will lead a team of Project Managers who have a range of technical and business resources across Europe and ensure effective delivery of solutions and projects for clients once they are effectively scoped out and solution designed. They already have a number of big programmes and projects in the pipeline with major financial and banking clients so this is a very exciting time for the Programme Manager to join. A background in Banking Transaction/Trade Finance would be desirable but not essential, the most important thing is strong project management skills, ability to face off to clients (pre sales type work), scope out necessary project work and to lead resources to deliver effective solutions. With this in mind it is an ideal role for a Programme Manager / Senior Project Manager (within software house/vendor) who is looking for a new challenge and enjoys getting a lot of exposure both on the business and technical side and will be a driving force behind delivery. This role is predominately London based but please note as the PM will have a team of Project Managers across Europe they may have some travel but can be quite limited dependent on the preference of the individual as the major banking clients are in London. Ideal Skills/Experience: Strong Project Management capability, in particular for Project Scoping and understanding the needs of a client/business and ability to design effective solution. Any knowledge of Trade Finance / Banking Transactions is ideal, general finance/banking knowledge would also be desirable. Good leadership skills, ability to lead project managers and multiple projects across a number of international locations. Experience in a Software / Banking Vendor or Consultancy environment in client facing role Ability to face off to Business and Technical stakeholders both internally and externally.</ns1:description>
