<ns1:description>Do you know much about data and how having the right data works? Perhaps you even have a working knowledge of data mining tools and CRM systems from a previous role? We are looking for an Account Manager to compliment this highly successful and driven Account Management team. Your role will be to co-ordination of all the customers needs and you will be conversing with them daily via email and the telephone; so excellent communication skills are a must.

For this company is all about the customer experience, something very topical today. However, how you are treated at work by the business is reflective of this. This is a casual and very modern working environment, with a great benefits package and free parking on the doorstep! Every day is a jeans/chinos day here, unless someone very important is coming in. As you walk into the office the atmosphere is always warm and inviting. As a keen developer of business you will be looking for opportunities to up-sell the businesses services to your clients but this will be in a consultative and soft capacity, there are no hard sales involved.

We perceive the strategic fundamentals of a business and understand how these translate into day to day operations, discern the relationships between business functions and expose how complex organisations are served by assets and technology. This gives us a unique perspective on capital investment, operational expenditure, how assets create business value and how organisations carry and manage risk. From boardroom down and technology up, our understanding of the complex, interconnected systems that make up a business enables us to create a line of sight between corporate strategy and asset operations, and to take on and solve the toughest problems for our most vital strategic infrastructure organisations.

<ns1:description>Our client is a successful management consultancy working with clients in the public and private sector. They are now looking for a bright &quot;2nd jobber&quot; for their newly established Insight and Analytics team. Initially you will be delivering customer insight in the local government context, where insight is a key to releasing money by reducing service demand, failure demand and wastage in order to direct investment to support front line services.

You will have a good degree in a numerate discipline such as statistics or data science, and will have had at least 2 years’ data analysis experience in a similar role.

<ns1:description>Have you recently completed your PhD or MSc in a numerate subject matter from a top-tier University, and are you looking to get into the exciting world of Data Science? If doing this for an established Consultancy within the Financial Services sector appeals, read on! The business is part of a very large, multi-national corporate brand. But are innovative, agile and entrepreneurial. They have to be, since they&apos;re a consultancy who carry out projects on behalf of a wide array of external clients. You will be joining a team of 4, within a wider division of 30. The work you will be taking on will offer variety and the chance to learn so much because of the kinds of projects you will undertake for end clients. For example, you could be working on a range of optimisation or propensity models, working across a portfolio of financial products and services. You could also be working across behavioural economics, notably linking behavioural analytics to economics. This is an exciting opportunity for a recent graduate who has the relevant qualifications in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance with significant exposure to quantitative analytics and a good basis within computational programming utilising a recognised analysis/modelling tool. This is a Big Data environment and it&apos;s expected you will be comfortable taking on a role that&apos;s got a lot of emphasis on programmatic, notably utilising SQL as a fundamental, but with either Python, R or Julia in support and some data visualisation work with Tableau too. Initially you will be mainly doing hands-on analysis work, but as you develop and grow you will be able to get in front of clients and drive the insight first-hand too. The team you will be joining is made up of mainly PhD graduates from top-tier Universities. This is reflected within the senior leadership too. But they&apos;re not just brilliant minds, they&apos;re all commercially grounded too, understanding the implications of suggested actions from data and able to demonstrate commercial benefit to a business too. As such they&apos;re really keen to engage someone similar, who&apos;s keen to learn still and embed themselves in the data science field, learning the programmatic side whilst being able to balance the commercial reasoning too. If this sounds like a role that aligns with your qualifications and future aspirations then please feel free to apply and get in touch! Role: Data Scientist - Data Analyst Location: London Salary: ?35,000-?45,000 KEY EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: - Recent graduate (if PhD) or someone with a couple of years commercial experience within the Data Science field - Must hold a numerate degree in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance. MSc or PhD is a big advantage - Essential experience using SQL and one of the following: R, Python, Julia, SAS or SPSS - Knowledge of database skills - programming, manipulations, handling and mining. - Experience in statistical, quantitative analysis and notably modelling - You need to be able to work collaboratively to implement change - Be able to communicate and engage the business when providing key insights around performance and data analysis - Have enthusiasm about a fast-evolving consultancy For further information please contact: Maddie Tait Associate Consultant - Blue Pelican Marketing You can view all our vacancies on our web site , or call and ask for the marketing division.</ns1:description>
