<ns1:description>QA Engineers with 1 to 3 years experience (manual or automation) are sought by this technology-driven FTSE100 company to join their Development team as a Software Development Engineer In Test and take part in a 6 month on-the-job-training period where they will be taught to program in Java. This position is a permanent position from day one, but the training will be a well funded, structured training session for a period of 6 months where technologists who have a passion for QA and automating as much of the test process as possible will be trained to become a Software Development Engineer In Test who uses Java to build software that tests software. WHAT IS A &quot;SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER IN TEST&quot;? &quot;A Software Development Engineer In Test … is a QA but the focus is on writing automated tests rather than on creating and running manual test cases. Think of it as writing software to test software. It can be a particularly challenging career choice because it takes both programming skill and a good understanding of software testing.&quot; So in summary its: - A QA - who can write Java code - and use that code to write software to test software WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? In many technology-driven company QA ends up being the poor relation to the development team. However at this FTSE100 company they want their SDET career path to be just as prestigious and as enviable as a developer career path. So they have beefed up their own existing SDET team with seniors from Amazon and Google at the higher end of the corporate ladder, and at the junior end they want to invest heavily in a class of Software Development Engineers In Test who will be well trained and highly technically competent. This company is committed to building a world-class Software Development Engineer In Test team!! WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR? This company hires on behaviours and not skills, so rather than look for the finished article, they are looking to hire Test Analysts and QAs with 1 to 3 years experience who: - have a computer science, or numerate degree (Physics, Biochem, Maths, etc) - have some level of experience writing code - have chosen a career in testing and QA - have a track record of pushing themselves to excel at the things they are passionate about what they do Any experience with Test Automation tools like Selenium, QTP, TDD, Unit testing, Jenkins or API driven testing would be desirable although not essential.

<ns1:description>About the role We all take a great deal of pride in our work, and it’s important to us that everyone sees the fruits of their labour. A typical project progresses from inception to deployment in less than a week, allowing you to quickly see your hard work live on our public platforms. We have a range of systems including our desktop site, mobile site, mobile app, administration system, customer portal and embedded systems - used in third party websites (desktop and mobile). We are constantly developing all of these to add new features, handle increasing scale, improve usability and support new platforms. You will be working closely with the Senior Test Engineer, the Software Development Manager, the developers and the designers to create new and improve existing features as well as liaising with our Systems Administrators and user support team to investigate and resolve issues. We’re just growing our Test Engineering team, so there’s plenty of exposure to be had and opportunities to influence the direction of testing. To start off, you’ll work on all aspects of the UNiDAYS offering, using your experience to test the changes we’re making to deliver a great Christmas campaign. Recent examples have been spinning some of our core functions out to independent microservices, improving our compliance with accessibility standards and implementing A/B testing for our email campaigns. Later, you’ll be knee deep in the nitty-gritty of a change, tasking a developer on an unforeseen impact of his code, performing ad-hoc and exploratory tests or running tools to make sure our users get the best possible experience. We’re already active in 7 countries, but we’re building a platform to scale globally as UNiDAYS helps students in every country save money. On top of that, it still needs to look good, respond quickly, be secure, deploy easily and of course, functionally work.  What we need from our Test Engineer:  Proven/Demonstrable experience testing and giving feedback on large, public facing web applications Proven test ownership abilities - the ability to lead the test strategy for a discrete piece of work Strong communication skills and a burning need to ask questions Experience with any of the following would be beneficial, but non-essential: MVC applications, i18n &amp; l10n, iOS, Android, test automation, tools-assisted testing, Jenkins, uptime monitoring, reading C# / HTML / JavaScript, security/penetration testing, performance testing. ISEB/ISTQB not required. It’s obvious to everyone around you that you have passion for your work and have fun with your co-workers – because they are doing the same. Everyone knows that when you take on a task whether it’s huge and scary or tiny and boring, you’re going to see it through to the best of your ability and we will provide you the support to do it – every step of the way. You love to teach and learn from your co-workers and we love to teach you too.Tell us what you have been reading recently and what has been piquing your interest at the moment. Focused We aren’t an agency with external clients imposing impossible time/budget deadlines, our code IS our business and so ensuring a consistently high level of quality is paramount. Our guiding principles are: Zero technical debt Quality Scalability and Performance Challenging Ourselves and Continuous Improvement If a job is going to take twice as long as its estimate to complete in order to achieve the level of quality we desire, then so be it (although we’ll expect an explanation). We won’t make you keep a timesheet. Agile Pragmatism Everyone is equal and encouraged to work with each other as best suited to solve problems. If you’ve got an idea or a request then there’s no red tape. If you can demonstrate its worth then it’s likely to happen - be it the use of a new technology, a piece of equipment or a change to our entire development approach. We try our best to apply Occam’s Razor to everything we do. Our product owners and stakeholders truly understand the value of iterative development and embrace the process of continual improvement. We continually strive to reduce waste by keeping paperwork and meetings to a minimum. The development team is physically centered around a giant glass Kanban board which we use to track the progress of high level priorities and individual tasks. This goes most of the way to eliminating problems with communication before they even occur. We try to test-drive all development, we have a sophisticated test environment that allows us to run our platforms entirely in memory - allowing us to perform truly end-to-end tests of our web pipeline. We try to thoroughly test all business logic, but also try hard not to go overboard and test the blatantly obvious, keeping refactoring simple and easy. Keep Your Tools Sharp We don’t scrimp on tech, you’ll get a beast of a machine with more RAM than you can shake a compiler at, SSDs as standard and at least as many monitors as you have eyes. Most importantly, you can choose your own peripherals. We’ll buy you any licenses you need to be productive. We’ll send you to any interesting conferences you can find, as well as support you if you want to be a speaker. We regularly attend, sponsor and speak at our local meetups and believe in supporting and giving back to the community. We’ve run free training workshops in the past and are looking into Code Club sponsorship. A Team That Plays Together Stay Together. We use Slack for internal comms (i.e. GIFs), we use Git properly, have a formidable Unreal Tournament team, bake cakes on Thursdays (compulsory), compete at table football, and are useless at ping pong and snooker despite having the facilities. Feel free to own someone from another department! You will also find us enjoying each others’ company outside of the office. Come Join Us You’ll love it as much as we do.
