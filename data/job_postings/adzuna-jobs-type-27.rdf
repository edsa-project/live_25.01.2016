<ns1:description>SQL DBA MI Developer Brighton The vacancy for this job of SQL DBA has arisen due to the expansion of my client&apos;s national infrastructure and a large investment in new technology. My central Brighton client has an enviable plan to invest in their IT department over the next 12 months. After spending the last part of last year upgrading their whole infrastructure, the next stage is to invest in re-organising the department and bringing in new talent to assist with the technology. This role will be newly created, and the successful candidate will be highly experienced in a similar position. You will have good hands-on experience with SQL 2012, and have used it for the support of high availability databases, disaster recovery, capacity planning, all stages of database infrastructure, server performance and SharePoint configuration. Also, due to the on-going projects, it would be a distinct advantage to have been involved with migrating data and applications over from a 2008 environment. If you would like to be considered for this position, please send your most recent and relevant CV.
