<ns1:description>Salary range: ?31033 to ?39142 per annum plus excellent benefits. Fixed-term for 3 years We have an exciting opportunity for a talented Senior Computer Programmer to join our high-throughput sequencing team in the Sanger Malaria Programme. As one of the world&apos;s leading malaria genetic research groups we are pioneering the use of next-generation sequencing technology to study genome variation in humans, mosquitoes (Anopheles) and parasite (Plasmodium), across large cohorts of thousands of samples. The goal of our work is to directly support global efforts to control malaria, by discovering novel drug and vaccine targets, by identifying emerging drug and insecticide mutations, and by monitoring genetics changes in global parasite and mosquito populations. We have generated some of the largest whole genome sequencing datasets available for any species, and the data we produce continues to grow exponentially. The bottleneck is now our ability to process and analyse data at this unprecedented scale. This role will design, develop, evaluate and run analytical pipelines to process high throughput sequence data and produce high quality data on genome variation. A key component will be engineering pipelines to be scalable and make the best possible use of the Sanger Institute&apos;s high performance compute facilities. The ideal candidate will have extremely strong skills in software engineering and will have first-hand experience of processing very large datasets in a scientific or commercial domain. Exceptional analytical skills are also required, and a strong interest in genome biology and the scientific aspects of whole genome sequencing is desirable. We are a multi-disciplinary team, and the successful application will work collaboratively with a range of other specialists including wet lab scientists, data analysts and statisticians, and malaria biologists and geneticists, so teamwork and a collaborative ethos are required. Essential Skills Postgraduate qualification in bioinformatics or computer science or a related subject * Exceptional software engineering skills with fluency in Perl * Experience of processing extremely large datasets on parallel computing clusters * Strong database development skills * Ability to work as part of a team or unsupervised to a very high standard * Strong analytical and problem solving * Strong written and oral communication Ideal Skills Experience of MySQL, Python, C/C++ * Knowledge of bioinformatic methods for processing next-generation sequencing data or similar * Experience of delivering high quality data products to scientists or other end users * Experience developing web-based data visualisation/reporting tools Other information The Sanger Institute is a charitably funded research centre focused on understanding the role of genetics in health and disease. We use state of the art large-scale genomic approaches to drive world-leading projects to uncover the basis of genetic and infectious disease.

<ns1:description>New Vacancy Central London Snr DevOps Engineer ?50&apos;000 - ?70&apos;000 I have an opportunity for two talented DevOps Engineers to join an exciting project team who are looking to build a high performance cloud based computing platform. This role is critical to the project as it will allow a well-funded research program delve into big data analytics on a cloud based platform. The right candidate will be an expert when it comes to automating Linux environments and be a strong coder at heart with a passion for delivering cutting edge code. The crux of this position is ensuring the project team is able to automate its infrastructure delivery through the use of provisioning tools like Puppet and Salt Stack. This project is cloud based so experience working with virtualized environments is a must. You will be experienced with development and will be comfortable working in a role that requires you to develop new code to manage CI and automation of infrastructure services. This role would suit a developer with good python skills who is keen to move into a DevOps role as much as a career DevOps engineer. In previous roles you will have worked through an agile framework with short sprints and TDD techniques during the development of applications, you will also be looked upon to improve the working practices of the development side of the Ops team. Finally you will be a strong communicator and able to own certain areas of the DevOps space as the project progresses and more resource is required to complete the automation. Skills: Strong experience with provisioning tools eg. Puppet, Salt Stack or Chef Solid development experience with Python, Ruby, Java etc. Shell scripting Experience with VMware or equivalent Excellent communicator and able to deal with stakeholders of all levels Desirable Skills: Strong Python development experience Ruby Jenkins Jira Vagrant For more information or to apply please contact Alec Dewell on or</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>We&apos;re looking for an outstanding software developer to join our software team. You&apos;ll work with us to specify, design and build new products. You&apos;ll evaluate new technologies, adopt and refine new working practices; and most importantly write lucid, high performance, maintainable code which will form the backbone of new product ranges. You&apos;ll also contribute to the maintenance of existing and future products, working with real-time software, RTOS applications, desktop applications, iOS Apps, and DSP algorithms - but don&apos;t worry, we don&apos;t expect you to be an expert in all of them! An ideal candidate is likely to be: A high performing graduate, probably in Computer Science Familiar with a variety of programming languages, platforms and operating systems (C/C++ (essential); Objective-C++, OS X, Windows, iOS, Unix, Cocoa, Qt and C# also desirable) Experienced or interested in the development of consumer “shrink wrapped” software Passionate about programming, application software, music and audio An excellent designer, debugger and problem solver A clear communicator Pragmatic, curious and flexible About us We’ll be honest – Focusrite is a pretty great place to work. Incorporating both the Focusrite and Novation brands, we make music easy to make, from bedroom DJs to the greatest show on earth. Everyone who works here has an enormous passion for music: as it says on our website, sound is everything. We take that very seriously – though we have a lot of fun doing it. As the number one selling audio interface brand worldwide, Focusrite has an illustrious, prestigious, and, let’s face it, cool history. Alongside Novation, the hardware and software that we develop plays an instrumental (see what we did there?) role in shaping the sound of modern music. From amateur to pro, our goal is to help musicians to make their music the very best it can be. Music has always been an exciting thing to be involved with, and that’s not about to change. We embrace its evolution, and that means being open to new ideas. Our whole business is structured to let everyone contribute and be heard at all levels, and we make sure it’s a fun place to work. Company hack-days, external visits – we’re all about innovation, fresh thinking and great, great products. (Plus, you get a free lunch in the canteen. No really.) We work hard. We are professional. We select really, really talented people. And we absolutely love our work. So if you think you can bring something new to the mix, we’ll be looking forward to hearing from you.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>As well as being the world’s largest broker, this corporate broking behemoth also controls the largest portfolio in Leeds. For those seeking a true corporate environment, there can surely be no better place to progress their career. The role of a Project Manager is both extremely varied and challenging, and you will be required to either lead or have influence on number of assignments spanning multiple business areas, including new business, existing clients and internal processes. It is worth stressing that, unlike with similar Project Manager roles with competing firms, whilst you will work in conjunction with business development teams, you will not be burdened with new business targets, or be directly accountable for generating brokerage. You will develop a detailed knowledge of individual clients, key insurers and other business areas, and enjoy a high degree of interaction with senior personnel within the business. As such, this is a very involved and visible role, and you will enjoy a high profile within the business, both locally and nationally. It is important to note that this role is by no means a step away from &apos;hands-on broking’, and you will still be involved in insurance programme design, account management and the placement of risks. You will also be expected to work in a client facing capacity, visiting both existing and prospective clients, in order to develop a detailed knowledge of their businesses and establish the best way of working together moving forward. Over recent years, this broker has been looking into innovative ways to communicate with clients. This includes using new media to supplement extensive and complex broking reports with more user-friendly information such as infographics and video pitches. As such, we are particularly keen to speak to insurance professionals who can present the headline points of reports for corporate clients, in a more &apos;easy to digest’ fashion without dumbing-down the content. Our client’s Leeds office controls some of the region’s largest and therefore most prestigious and complex accounts, including a significant number of six figure income cases. Its clientele span a wide range of sectors, including both blue and white collar industries. As such, it is vital that you have a detailed knowledge of all common covers, and exposure to handling corporate business. In order to manage relationships with a variety of stakeholders, you must have strong negotiation, communication and influencing skills. Given the varied nature of this position, you must also be well- organised and able to constantly reprioritise an ever-changing workload. In return, you will receive a highly competitive salary, company car, bonus, executive level benefits and the kind of opportunities for progression that can only be associated with careers at leading globals.

<ns1:description>This is a cracking opportunity based in the heart of the City. We are looking for a charismatic commercial analyst to support a global implementation team in a progressive company at the forefront of maritime, aviation, government and enterprise communications operating in over 80 countries with more than 40 offices worldwide. The cornerstone of your role will be to understand how new products, services and requisite system changes impact on user and customer experience and translate these into requirements that are technical in nature yet firmly customer-centric. Thus an aptitude for working with technical people and a passion for high technology would certainly help as you seek to make it easier for both internal users and customers to understand and adopt change. At the heart of this project is a need to provide end to end solutions that grasp how change needs to be considered and dealt with by all departments, although your primary contacts will be those analysts/developers who deal with business support systems, Customer Services and the Global Training Academy. The role also requires exceptional juggling, documentation, writing and inter-personal skills as you alternate between working closely with internal/external customers to extract/respond to information and ensuring all activities are meticulously captured as sharp, articulate requirements that can be acted upon. Character is all. You must be someone who is a natural starter-finisher retaining enthusiasm for chasing detail in the crunch phase of delivery. Energy, creativity and determination will allow you to operate effectively as you grapple with various rationales for change across the business. On this front, it will certainly help if you have had exposure to innovative product/service development before, particularly from an end user perspective. Lastly, as this is a new role at the hub of next generation communication solutions, you will quickly be able to establish yourself as an invaluable source of knowledge adding value at every turn. Responsibilities You will drive end to end change by effectively articulating user and customer requirements through documents and interactions with colleagues. A hands on approach will ensure that you are always aware of the challenges of new and existing platforms and the changes made to these. Most importantly you will thrive on finding innovative solutions to work with these challenges. You will be responsible for creating and updating technical and communication materials for audiences from Sales to Customer Services etc. You will be proactive in maintaining solid commercial knowledge enabling you to design appropriate materials and solutions for customers. You will work with the Global Training Academy to devise new material based on business support systems such as provisioning, service activations, account balance and customer support. You will need to review external customer communications and find the best words and ways to ensure clarity and simplicity is delivered. Essential At least 3 years business analysis experience, ideally within a telecoms/high technology setting with a product/service management or customer service focus. Ability to author, develop and update technical requirements documentation without relying heavily on cutting and pasting others’ work. Whilst technical at times, you enjoy creating requirement documentation that reflects the needs of user and customer. Exposure to systems - being able to independently work on a variety of technical/system projects at various stages in a product roadmap, dealing with BSS and/or OSS technologies. Technologically curious and proficient. Enjoy a challenging work environment that requires significant flexibility, self-direction and creativity. Experienced in establishing and using communication mediums that develop a collaborative approach to problem solving and knowledge sharing. You will be experienced in reviewing customer communications.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Market Researcher - FRENCH ?15,000 - ?17,000 Aldershot Our client requires candidates who are fluent speaking/writing in any of the following languages FRENCH. If you are fluent in any of these languages then this is an excellent opportunity to pursue a Market Research career. This is a very friendly office environment to work in with opportunities to progress in to more senior positions. The client is looking for a candidate with a positive outlook who would enjoy calling clients to gather information on their business. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To gather information on companies and contacts and the technology in use within the companies. KEY METHODOLOGIES Extraction of information from published materials - e.g. web sites; Annual Reports; press articles Telephone conversations - each call has the objective of gaining the answer to a specific question - it may be contact-related or aimed at gathering information on the size of an organisation or to identify companies using a specific technology KEY RESPONSIBILITIES CONTACT CHECKING This is the most straightforward element of the role of Researcher and is the initial focus in terms of training. Contacts that are on the client&apos;s database must be checked in detail before clients can use the information. These details then need to be verified again every 6 months. Much of this checking and verification is conducted by telephone. We may speak with Receptionists, HR Departments, Secretaries etc. in order to check some of the details as well as speaking with the contact directly. In all cases, we are simply checking or gathering information - we are NEVER selling or marketing to these contacts or companies CONTACT DISCOVERY In many instances, we do not know who fulfils a specific role within a company; it might be that we do not know who is the Human Resources Director or the IT Director - in that case, we telephone the company and ask for this information. We initially speak with Receptionists, HR Departments, Secretaries and colleagues within the relevant department in order to identify the correct person and then we speak with the contact directly. DATABASE UPDATING All information that is gathered is updated into the database using our web-based applications. A key focus of this part of the job is to identify the appropriate classifications to be included on the records so that they can be retrieved when required by clients - the classification systems must be understood and applied - this is a key part of the training we provide. COMPANY INFORMATION Whenever possible, we use published material for this task since it is easier and quicker and the source is reliable. Where that is not possible, we will telephone in order to gather that information. Training is provided in this company research process once a Researcher has shown progress in achieving competence in Contact Checking and Contact Discovery. The information gathered includes sizing information (e.g. number of staff, number of branches, number of PCs); classification (e.g. industry sectors; what does the company specifically do); technology (does the company use a specific software or hardware product etc.) These calls are usually made to specific contacts within these companies and the conversations and the resultant updates to the database are somewhat more involved, which is why more experience is required. QUALITY Quality is paramount Our reputation is that we deliver the highest quality - that reputation has been hard won but can easily be lost if we don’t focus on quality at all times Therefore, our absolute focus is at all times on quality and completeness. Attention to detail is imperative and getting it right is an obsession - if we at any time have any doubt that we have gathered the correct information, our standard is to do the research again DEADLINES It is imperative that we deliver on schedule - thus, everyone is expected to be aware of deadlines and scheduled progress and everyone is expected to do their utmost to ensure that they are met CAREER PROGRESSION We have a strategy to promote from within - we recruit at Researcher level only and enable those with the drive, capability and commitment to progress into the other roles. This role of Researcher is essential preparation for all other roles within our business. To achieve full competence in this role, a thorough appreciation of the applications, methodologies and processes needs to be gained. Given this competence, opportunities exist to progress into other roles - for example: SENIOR RESEARCHER/TEAM LEADER This role involves being a lead researcher on projects, working with a project team, mentoring and assisting the less experienced team members, devising strategies, tactics and processes for those projects and leading by example ACCOUNT MANAGER This is a key role within our business and involves taking responsibility for all communications with and activities on behalf of a portfolio of clients. Our Account Managers are responsible for all aspects of customer service and the expansion of our service within those clients. The Account Managers also work with prospective clients to introduce them to the unique quality of our solution and to cement a relationship for their use of our service. Since our clients are located throughout Europe ( as well as the UK, USA, Canada, etc.), language skills can be a significant asset in this role. OTHER ROLES All of our team joined us initially in a research role - other career progression opportunities include joining the Data Integration and Data Quality teams or progressing into Marketing (we have sponsored 2 of our team to gain formal marketing qualifications and will consider other such initiatives) and, perhaps, technical support.

Training is provided in this company research process once a Researcher has shown progress in achieving competence in Contact Checking and Contact Discovery. The information gathered includes sizing information (e.g. number of staff, number of branches, number of PCs); classification (e.g. industry sectors; what does the company specifically do); technology (does the company use a specific software or hardware product etc.) These calls are usually made to specific contacts within these companies and the conversations and the resultant updates to the database are somewhat more involved, which is why more experience is required. QUALITY Quality is paramount Our reputation is that we deliver the highest quality - that reputation has been hard won but can easily be lost if we don’t focus on quality at all times Therefore, our absolute focus is at all times on quality and completeness. Attention to detail is imperative and getting it right is an obsession - if we at any time have any doubt that we have gathered the correct information, our standard is to do the research again DEADLINES It is imperative that we deliver on schedule - thus, everyone is expected to be aware of deadlines and scheduled progress and everyone is expected to do their utmost to ensure that they are met CAREER PROGRESSION We have a strategy to promote from within - we recruit at Researcher level only and enable those with the drive, capability and commitment to progress into the other roles. This role of Researcher is essential preparation for all other roles within our business. To achieve full competence in this role, a thorough appreciation of the applications, methodologies and processes needs to be gained. Given this competence, opportunities exist to progress into other roles - for example: SENIOR RESEARCHER/TEAM LEADER This role involves being a lead researcher on projects, working with a project team, mentoring and assisting the less experienced team members, devising strategies, tactics and processes for those projects and leading by example ACCOUNT MANAGER This is a key role within our business and involves taking responsibility for all communications with and activities on behalf of a portfolio of clients. Our Account Managers are responsible for all aspects of customer service and the expansion of our service within those clients. The Account Managers also work with prospective clients to introduce them to the unique quality of our solution and to cement a relationship for their use of our service. Since our clients are located throughout Europe ( as well as the UK, USA, Canada, etc.), language skills can be a significant asset in this role. OTHER ROLES All of our team joined us initially in a research role - other career progression opportunities include joining the Data Integration and Data Quality teams or progressing into Marketing (we have sponsored 2 of our team to gain formal marketing qualifications and will consider other such initiatives) and, perhaps, technical support.
