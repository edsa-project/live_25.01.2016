The role will be focused within care, and specifically with an Adult Social Care focus, to capture, accurately document and implement user and business requirements. The Product Owner will also be expected to translate user requirements into functional components, user stories and acceptance criteria working closely with the development teams. This role requires a high level of technical competency, and will entail working within the overall Product Manager in an Agile development environment.

The successful candidate must be able to rapidly assimilate information into clearly written user stories, sometimes against short timescales and then translate these into integrated solutions. We are particularly interested in meeting individuals who are passionate about and experienced in contributing to the specification and design of market leading software solutions to meet the needs of Care Professionals within the Adult Social Care setting. A desire to build top quality products and an aptitude for identifying ways of improving process and workflow through technology with an appropriate track record are highly desirable. The role will require the successful individual to travel to client sites and to our other offices - a current driving license will be required. There may be some requirement for overnight stays and candidates must be willing and able to travel as required and to stay away when required for short periods of time.

<ns1:description>We are a passionate team of developers and are looking for a new member to join our growing team. We offer a great environment to unleash your true talent, seeking someone who is already confident with C# and the .NET framework. To be the sort of person that we are looking for you will…. • Be keen to work as part of a team and be happy having your ideas out in public and challenged. • Have opinions about software development that you are willing to defend and you will try to positively influence the thinking of others. • Show a genuine desire to be better at everything you do. • Be interested in things like functional programming, or Angular, or Node, or Raven, or Mongo or some other flavour of NoSQL. • Maybe know something about what you’ll find under the #noestimates hashtag. • Probably have books on your shelves by Bob Martin, Kent Beck, and Jeff Sutherland. • You won’t care whether you are writing a brand new application, or sorting out someone else’s old mess - it will still be a challenge that you can use initiative and new ideas to solve. • Will most likely be following Alistair Cockburn, Ian Cooper, and Martin Fowler on twitter. • You’ll probably like technology and gadgets and might have tried running OS X on your raspberry Pi and will want to tell everybody about it. • You will be able to talk to us about agile and Lean and why you like working in this way - or why you don’t. • You’ll be proud to share your github username and to tell us about the open source projects you contribute to. Our new product development teams work on a wide range of products all servicing the legal market. There is a mix of pure green-field product development as well as enhancements and improvements over existing legacy products (although there is no first line support requirement in these roles). In many situations developers are free to choose the technologies and techniques required to deliver the requirements that are being asked of them. We use a Kanban system to drive value and we truly value Test first development, XP practices, and emergent design. Team members regularly attend development events and conferences and there is weekly hand-on training in the office as well as top industry professional working with us on site when required. As an example we’ve had Greg Young with us to help us adopt EventStore for two full weeks over the last year. In addition to this we offer a comprehensive range of benefits, a relaxed working environment, and many opportunities to learn and progress.</ns1:description>
