<ns1:description>Bioinformatician Location: EMBL-EBI Hinxton, nr Cambridge, UK Contract Duration: 2 years and 10 months Grading: 5 or 6 depending on skills and experience Closing Date: 7 December 2015 Reference Number: EBI_00637 Job Description - Bioinformatician We are seeking a talented Bioinformatician to work on the assembly and annotation of insect genomes. You will join the Non-vertebrate Genomics team at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), located on the Wellcome Genome Campus near Cambridge in the UK. Biting midges of the genus Culicoides are important vectors of animal diseases. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is the vector of a variety of important crop diseases, including viral diseases of cassava. We have funding from the United Kingdom Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, and by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to work on both of these important insects. Our role in both these projects involves genome annotation, assembly, and comparative analysis, in the context of international collaborative efforts to understand the biology and enable the control of the diseases they spread. This work will be embedded within the wider efforts of the Ensembl Metazoa project, in which we organise and disseminate genome-scale data from invertebrate species to enable and accelerate scientific research as part of the wider service mission of the EBI. We are looking to hire a creative and experienced Bioinformatician to drive these projects forward. The successful candidate will be interested in insect biology, and enthusiastic about collaborating with our partners to use the emerging data to research the serious pathologies caused by the viruses these insects transmit. They will also be interested in the development of the Ensembl platform at all levels (from specification through to implementation) to maximise the impact of these new genomic data on the relevant research communities. EMBL-EBI is part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and is Europe&apos;s leading provider of information services to biological researchers in academia and industry. EMBL-EBI staff enjoy many benefits including sports facilities, a free shuttle bus to Cambridge and other nearby centres, and an attractive working environment set in 55 acres of parkland alongside being close to major transport links to London. Our salary scales are very competitive. Qualifications and Experience required for the Bioinformatician Applicants should have a degree in a biological or computer science, and at least 2 years of proven bioinformatics experience. A relevant higher degree such as an MSc in Bioinformatics or Computer Science, PhD or equivalent work experience is required. Experience of data delivery in the context of large collaborative projects is particularly relevant. Candidates should be able to demonstrate expertise in one or many of the following: next generation sequencing, genome assembly, annotation, and data management. Applicants should be highly proficient in at least 1 modern programming language (e.g. Perl, Java) and the use of relational database management systems. Knowledge of NoSQL data storage, workflow/grid/cloud technologies, and the Ensembl platform, are desirable but not essential. Candidates must be open to working with additional technologies according to the needs of the projects. Maintaining communication with our partners, and with other team members, will be critical to the success of the work: good communication and interpersonal skills are therefore essential as you will be expected to represent the team at international meetings, give presentations, contribute to training materials and courses both internally and externally and produce project specific and general user documentation. A flexible mind set, a capacity for independent work, and a high level of intellectual curiosity are additionally required. Benefits EMBL is an inclusive, equal opportunity employer offering attractive conditions and benefits appropriate to an international research organisation. The remuneration package comprises a competitive salary, a comprehensive pension and health insurance, educational and other family related benefits where applicable, as well as financial support for relocation and installation. We provide a dynamic, international working environment and have close ties with the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Additional Information We welcome applications irrespective of gender and appointment will be based on merit alone. Applications are welcome from all nationalities - visa information will be discussed in more depth with applicants selected for interview. Applications for the position will close at 23:00 GMT on the date listed above.</ns1:description>

The PA will also have their own personal workload and responsibilities, including: carrying out specific projects and research; responsibility for accounts and budgets; taking on some of the manager&apos;s responsibilities and working more closely with management; deputising for the manager, making decisions and delegating work to others in the manager&apos;s absence.</ns1:description>
