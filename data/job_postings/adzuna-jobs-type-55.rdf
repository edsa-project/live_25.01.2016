<ns1:description>Senior / Lead Statistical Analyst UK&apos;s most up and coming Analytics Agency Data Science Technologies / Global Clients ! CLIENT A unique opportunity has arisen for a senior level statistical Analyst looking to broaden their analytical skills and industry experience. This thriving, passionate and cutting edge analytical consultancy have offices across the UK, and work with some of the world&apos;s most recognizable brands, on an international basis. This role is based in Central London, with time on site at clients, all within the London area. This is a fantastic opportunity for a client facing Senior Analyst looking to grow and develop their skills using statistical tools such as R, WPS, Python, SAS and SQL. You will be working amongst an entire business of Analysts ranging in seniority and skill set. They have analysts with broad backgrounds ranging across digital, media, customer and marketing analytics, geographical planning and financial so you will always be learning new things from your peers. At this level you would be expected to either formally manage a team of up to 5 analysts or at least work as the lead analysts in specific accounts. The format and structure of this business is flexible and can work to meet your needs and aspirations, due to the fact it&apos;s still a young business. Technically they currently use SQL, R and WPS, but are happy to consider analysts that have used EITHER SAS, SPSS, SQL or R and any web analytics experience would be highly beneficial! However, if you have not had any exposure to online analytical tools and techniques, this is something they will teach you - another added benefit. Your work will be varied, across campaign analysis, customer insights work and using statistical techniques. They value their staff development and job satisfaction very highly, and take the time with every new employee at the beginning of their tenure to create a Personal Development Plan, which is written by you and as long as is reasonable and beneficial, is implemented immediately. If you are eager to learn from others, gain exposure to a variety of analytical tools, techniques and customer data then this agency would be right for you. Finally, they rightly pointed out that often analysts are unable to utilise a lot of the analytical techniques they&apos;ve learn through their degree in the real world, and here, you can. Because the business is purely made up of analysts, there is huge amount of opportunity to expand your skills and use techniques you may not have the chance to use in a large corporate environment. EXPERIENCE REQUIRED *Educated to degree level in a relevant and ideally numerate subject *Strong experience in Statistical Analysis or Propensity Modelling or Segmentation *Expert experience with at least one of the following tools to a coding level: Python, SAS, SPSS, SQL, R *Passion for data and all things analytical *Confidence to work in a client facing capacity *Experience in mentoring or managing more junior members of staff LOCATION - Central London SALARY - ?50k - ?65k plus benefits and training opportunities TO APPLY For further information or to apply please contact: Kate McDermott Managing Consultant - Blue Pelican Marketing For more vacancies which may suit your needs, please visit us at</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Market researcher / statistical analyst - ?19-?25k plus bonus - Hants Fantastic opportunity: your first or second job in market research and analysis. This agency is located in a lively and charming city, only about an hour from London, close to the countryside and coast. They offer a formidable all-round research service to their clients - from exploring the concept, taste, smell, packaging and pricing, of products to measuring emotional responses to advertising using cutting edge neuroscience techniques. No wonder they have such an impressive client list. Friendly and sociable, with a focus on people development, they are big enough to provide a stable environment, successful enough to be growing steadily and innovative enough to welcome new ideas. In this really varied role you will spend most of your time working on consumer research projects as part of a team, getting involved in tasks such as questionnaire design, developing reports and creating results presentations. However, there is also a strong statistics element to this particular role. Once you are up and running you will be analysing datasets, using techniques from simple significance testing through to conjoint and regression modelling and perhaps even Baysian analysis. To be a serious contender for this role, you will have strong numerical and communications skills, great attention to detail and a friendly, confident manner. Your qualifications will include a 2-1 or above in a strongly numerate degree. Experience of programmes such as SPSS, SAS and R will be a definite advantage, as will a driving licence and a willingness to travel. The higher end of the salary scale is reserved for candidates already working in a similar role.</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Large manufacturing company require a Strategic Marketing Assistant to support their busy Strategic Marketing team. The role This is an entry level positon ideal for a recent graduate who wants to get a foot on the ladder and pursue a career in strategic marketing. While there is a large element of admin with this role, you will be on hand to support the team with any other ad hoc tasks that help the department run smoothly. If you are someone who loves the creative side of marketing, this isn&apos;t the role for you. You won&apos;t be designing marketing collateral or writing content. This role is for someone who loves working with figures and gets a kick from providing a business with the kind of statistical information that will help them to drive it forward. Working with the Strategic Marketing Manager as well as other teams (internal and external), you&apos;ll develop and maintain bespoke marketing systems and companywide CRM programs. One major part of the role will be to research industry statistics to help create a strategy for the year ahead, such as analysing exhibition attendance data to determine which future exhibitions will be beneficial for the company to attend. You will be responsible for researching statistics and undertaking competitor analysis, plus helping to compile a bimonthly report from google alerts and trade press. What we&apos;re looking for We&apos;re looking for someone with an interest in strategies and data, plus a background in marketing. We&apos;re not looking for years and years of strategy marketing experience (not saying that it wouldn&apos;t be great if you have it!), but you do need to be able to demonstrate an interest in this field. Perhaps you have had a placement year or internship in a similar environment. It would be great to see someone who is working towards a CIM qualification or has aspirations to undertake one in the future. You must be confident in collating figures and be able to work in MS Office (PowerPoint, Word, Excel, Outlook). As you will be reporting your findings to stake holders and colleagues at every level, it is essential that you are confident in dealing with people and have an ability to maintain relationships. The role will sometimes require you to work beyond usual office hours, for example if the team are attending an exhibition, they may ask you to come in early or work late to help prepare or even attend the exhibition to make notes or take photos. Even though this isn&apos;t a creative role, it would be an advantage if you have some basic Adobe Photoshop/ Adobe InDesign knowledge as it is used to compile some company reports. What&apos;s on offer? This is a great opportunity to progress your career and become part of a valued team. Salary is ?14k to ?18k, dependant on experience. If you&apos;d like to discuss this role in more detail, please contact Lisa Newey on .</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Lead Risk Analyst - Nottingham - Permanent - ?35000 - ?45000 plus bens Large Nottingham based company - a leader in their field, seeks a new additional Risk Analyst. As a Lead Risk Analyst within the UK Credit Risk team you will be responsible for managing the companies growing credit risk exposures through on-going portfolio analysis and reporting and the management, optimisation and development of credit strategies across the whole customer lifecycle (from acquisition through to debt recovery) and subsequently driving the business forward through the generation of recommendations. Ideally suited to someone with :- • At least 3 or 4 years analytical experience and you are looking for your next step. • You are self-motivated and organised. You love structure and process, and some may even say you’re a little on the geeky side. My client likes that but not so geeky that you can’t talk to others - we want you to work between Credit, Group and the business so strong communication is important. • You are logical, analytical, and methodical. You have a natural curiosity that means you thrive on investigating data through analysis and its subsequent review and interpretation to provide great insight to the business in a simple easily understood way. • You enjoy statistical analysis and modelling and would flourish in working in collaboration with the central risk analytics team in the head office and C&amp;R teams in the branches to make recommendations for model redevelopment and provide expert oversight to ensure analytics are statistically valid and in line with local risk requirements and specification. What this role isn’t - This role is not a scorecard builder day in day out, nor is it a code developer and you don’t need to be a techie. But if you have experience in building a wide variety of statistical models and are looking for the opportunity to provide expert oversight and challenge other people’s analytics that would do nicely. If you understand how to apply analytics to develop credit risk strategy and effectively implement it into the business, even better. What will they give you? • You will have a unique opportunity to become part of an extremely proficient credit team. • You will have exposure to all areas of credit risk and other business areas through involvement in business wide project work. * If you have the follow systems experience this would also be an advantage :- SAS EG and Qlikview. Anyone with SAS/SPSS/Angoss/SQL experience would be suitable. • You will become part of an organisation which considers personal development paramount and encourages everyone to seek out progression opportunities both in the UK offices and abroad.</ns1:description>
