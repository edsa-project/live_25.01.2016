<ns1:description>This specialty civil engineering sub-contractor has an opening for an Estimator. Reporting directly to the Commercial Director, you will assist in preparing estimates for a wide range of construction services. The Role: As an Estimator, you will calculate quantity take-offs, material, labour and equipment costs, to prepare project cost estimates. You will be working with a variety of contractors to determine the scope of work and prepare final quotes, communicating pricing and scope of work letters to the customers. You will be researching historical data such as productivity analysis reports, then compile summary reports to develop guidelines and setting precedence and procedures for future estimates. You will create project updates and bid package estimate documents. Along with this you will also maintain files of working documents for back-up to the project estimates, assisting in analysing conceptual estimates against actual cost data. Our client also needs you to monitor bid results and competitor activity, as well as perform additional assignments as requested to further improve the estimating process. The Estimator role may involve a small element of travel for site visits, for which a Company vehicle can be provided, or a mileage allowance. The Candidate: In order to be considered for this exciting role you must have experience of estimating within a construction environment.

<ns1:description>Structural Design Engineer - Central London Background I am currently working very closely with an established structural and civil engineering consultancy in central London that has a fantastic reputation and is well known within the engineering fraternity for being involved with some far reaching and ground breaking projects. My Client prides themselves with their involvement in unusual projects, as much as they do by the fact that yet again they are being considered for another award. This is not your typical engineering consultancy! They deliver the full range of structural and civil engineering services with imagination and a holistic understanding of the built environment, adding creative value to architectural design and ever striving to achieve the architect&apos;s intent. The Opportunity My Client has the requirement to source a Design Engineer who will complement their 10 number team. The opportunity will allow the right individual to fit into the current gap to both assist the Senior Engineer with the workload, and to also mentor the less experienced graduates in the course of their work and the project in hand. This would therefore suit an engineer who is either Chartered or close to being. And, for this, you will be given the encouragement to grow yourself and to have an influential say in some truly inspiring projects. Experience &amp; skill set required A pre requisite shall be to demonstrate an interest in architecture, have experience of a range of projects, be well organised with the ability to deliver on a day to day basis with minimal direction. * Knowledge of engineering forms and precedents including why they were appropriate to the specific situations and the lessons learnt. * Experience of job planning and running to deliver technical and commercial success, including developing successful working relationships with other members of the project team. * Experience of scheming technical solutions and presenting these internally and externally. * The ability to design and detail in timber, steel, concrete and masonry. * The ability to analyse engineering structures in 2D &amp; 3D, select the appropriate methods of analysis for the current design stage and check the results are correct. * Able to present clear calculations to justify an engineering proposal and check the calculations prepared by others. * Knowledge of procurement and the relative merits of the different forms of contract. * Ability to inspect work on site, record opening up works and defects, recognise and report unsafe working practises. * Ability to managing own workload and those people working for you; give and receive effective briefings. * Applicants must have demonstrable UK experience be eligible to work in the UK.
