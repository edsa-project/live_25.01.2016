<ns1:description>The Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) is an international centre for scientific research situated in Grenoble, France. We are Europe&apos;s leading neutron science facility. We receive over 2000 visiting scientists per year to carry out world-class research in a wide variety of scientific fields.The ILL upgrade programme and the European SINE2020 project have a common goal to foster a collective, Europe-wide approach to data reduction and analysis that will transform data treatment for neutron scattering experiments for the decade to come. The Computing for Science (CS) Group in the ILL’s Science Division is therefore currently recruiting: Three Scientific Software Programmers (M/F) Duties: The mission of the CS Group is to deliver and support the critical data treatment software that enables visiting scientists to exploit their scattering data effectively during experiments.In this context, your duties will focus primarily on data reduction for a range of instruments in the Mantid code [www.mantidproject.org]. The work includes: writing loaders for ILL data which is in the NeXus/HDF5 format, implementing data reduction workflows based as far as possible on existing algorithms in the Mantid code, adding new algorithms, where necessary, validating results against existing software and implementing graphical user interfaces, interacting with scientists and software developers to ensure that software is delivered in a timely and effective manner. Qualifications and experience: You have - at least - a Master’s degree in a physical science or software engineering. You are: a software developer interested in working in a leading scientific facility or a scientist with a strong track-record in software development, expert in Python and C++ programming and familiar with the modern software development methods and environment (e.g. Eclipse, GitHub…), service-oriented and a committed team player in order to work effectively with members of the CS group, scientists and European partners. Language skills: As an international research centre, we are particularly keen to attract applicants from outside France. You must have a sound knowledge of English and be willing to learn French (a language course will be paid for by the ILL). Knowledge of German would be an advantage.
