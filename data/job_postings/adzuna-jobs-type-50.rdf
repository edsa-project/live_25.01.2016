<ns1:description>Implement global standards as you best see fit in an environment that will allow you to thrive through its unique culture and working style. This is a fantastic opportunity to work with, frankly, the employer of choice for most in the FMCG field. This business offers its employees complete independence and autonomy to perform in this role as well as they can. Every occasion I have visited the business people seem to be smiling and genuinely enjoying spending time at work. It has unrivalled career progression both upwards in the traditional way you would expect but also to other functions which you may not. It scores highly on employee satisfaction and is highly recommended. You will sit in the Quality and Food Safety team and as Food Safety Senior, reporting to the Food Safety Manager, you will be responsible for day-to-day safety within the factory. However, the larger focus of this role will be developing safety standards over a 3-4 year horizon so approx. 70% of this role is project based. Whilst sharing best practice with the rest of the business and engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, you will also be tasked with: Using projects to deliver step changes in quality and food safety Implementation of new standards and owning the training Building relationships with commercial, marketing, logistics and supply teams A high level of ability in Microbiology is required so specialist education in this field, or possibly from a Food Science/Technology degree will be looked for. Food safety experience within a large-scale FMCG manufacturer will also be key. As ever with a food safety role, having strong communication skills in order to discuss business issues with production will be required. This is a very exciting role with a growing, large business so apply now. To assist you searching for a role by location - we have added a generic postcode, when uploading the advert, that designates the centre of the county in which this job is found.

But are innovative, agile and entrepreneurial. They have to be, since they&apos;re a consultancy who carry out projects on behalf of a wide array of external clients. You will be joining a team of 4, within a wider division of 30. The work you will be taking on will offer variety and the chance to learn so much because of the kinds of projects you will undertake for end clients. For example, you could be working on a range of optimisation or propensity models, working across a portfolio of financial products and services. You could also be working across behavioural economics, notably linking behavioural analytics to economics. This is an exciting opportunity for a recent graduate who has the relevant qualifications in Computer Science, Data Analytics, Pattern Recognition, Physical Sciences, Economics or finance with significant exposure to quantitative analytics and a good basis within computational programming utilising a recognised analysis/modelling tool. This is a Big Data environment and it&apos;s expected you will be comfortable taking on a role that&apos;s got a lot of emphasis on programmatic, notably utilising SQL as a fundamental, but with either Python, R or Julia in support and some data visualisation work with Tableau too. Initially you will be mainly doing hands-on analysis work, but as you develop and grow you will be able to get in front of clients and drive the insight first-hand too. The team you will be joining is made up of mainly PhD graduates from top-tier Universities. This is reflected within the senior leadership too. But they&apos;re not just brilliant minds, they&apos;re all commercially grounded too, understanding the implications of suggested actions from data and able to demonstrate commercial benefit to a business too. As such they&apos;re really keen to engage someone similar, who&apos;s keen to learn still and embed themselves in the data science field, learning the programmatic side whilst being able to balance the commercial reasoning too. If this sounds like a role that aligns with your qualifications and future aspirations then please feel free to apply and get in touch!
