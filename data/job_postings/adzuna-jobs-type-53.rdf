<ns1:description>Are you a Recruitment Resourcer, or someone who has always wanted to learn? Do you want to recruit for some of the biggest names and coolest start-ups in the world? How about the idea of recruiting for positions in Asia, from Shanghai to Sydney and lots of interesting places in between? A great opportunity has arisen for a Recruitment Resourcer based in Manchester to join this expanding company. The company are looking for motivated and smart people who want to become an important part of the exciting journey ahead. The company has just finished its second birthday party and in the relatively short period of time it’s been going, the company has placed people in over 20 different countries across the world. The company has also grown a passionate, fun and globally facing team and is looking for a Recruitment Resourcer to join it. The company’s aim at the beginning was to do recruitment very differently. The days of sharky sales types, pinstripe suits and cheesy recruitment clich?s are long gone. It prefers a grown-up, but creative and casual approach to recruitment (every day is dress down day), but this doesn’t take away from the seriousness to do a great job. As the Recruitment Resourcer your duties will include: • Being part of job briefing calls with clients to gather requirements; • Managing the search for people with niche skills, engaging with them, talking to them and coaching them through the interview process right up to the offer stage; • Testing yourself on a daily basis, talking to some of the most intelligent people you&apos;re ever likely to meet (wait until your first encounter with a Data Scientist!); • Running talent mapping campaigns across the APAC region to identify the right people we need to speak with next. To be a successful Recruitment Resourcer you will have the following skills and experience: • An experienced Recruitment Resourcer OR someone who thinks they can do it! • Passionate about tech, IT or software (maybe a closet nerd?) • Know what a Software Engineer does (there may be a trick interview question for you...) • A strong communicator, with a passion for speaking to people in some of the most interesting places in the world! In return you will receive a negotiable salary plus a bonus and stock potential.</ns1:description>

The goal of our work is to directly support global efforts to control malaria, by discovering novel drug and vaccine targets, by identifying emerging drug and insecticide mutations, and by monitoring genetics changes in global parasite and mosquito populations. We have generated some of the largest whole genome sequencing datasets available for any species, and the data we produce continues to grow exponentially. The bottleneck is now our ability to process and analyse data at this unprecedented scale. This role will design, develop, evaluate and run analytical pipelines to process high throughput sequence data and produce high quality data on genome variation. A key component will be engineering pipelines to be scalable and make the best possible use of the Sanger Institute&apos;s high performance compute facilities.

<ns1:description>Are you a Recruitment Resourcer, or someone who has always wanted to learn? Do you want to recruit for some of the biggest names and coolest start-ups in the world? How about the idea of recruiting for positions in Asia, from Shanghai to Sydney and lots of interesting places in between? A great opportunity has arisen for a Recruitment Resourcer based in Manchester to join this expanding company. The company are looking for motivated and smart people who want to become an important part of the exciting journey ahead. The company has just finished its second birthday party and in the relatively short period of time it’s been going, the company has placed people in over 20 different countries across the world. The company has also grown a passionate, fun and globally facing team and is looking for a Recruitment Resourcer to join it. The company’s aim at the beginning was to do recruitment very differently. The days of sharky sales types, pinstripe suits and cheesy recruitment clich?s are long gone. It prefers a grown-up, but creative and casual approach to recruitment (every day is dress down day), but this doesn’t take away from the seriousness to do a great job. As the Recruitment Resourcer your duties will include: • Being part of job briefing calls with clients to gather requirements; • Managing the search for people with niche skills, engaging with them, talking to them and coaching them through the interview process right up to the offer stage; • Testing yourself on a daily basis, talking to some of the most intelligent people you&apos;re ever likely to meet (wait until your first encounter with a Data Scientist!); • Running talent mapping campaigns across the APAC region to identify the right people we need to speak with next. To be a successful Recruitment Resourcer you will have the following skills and experience: • An experienced Recruitment Resourcer OR someone who thinks they can do it! • Passionate about tech, IT or software (maybe a closet nerd?) • Know what a Software Engineer does (there may be a trick interview question for you...) • A strong communicator, with a passion for speaking to people in some of the most interesting places in the world! In return you will receive a negotiable salary plus a bonus and stock potential. Contact: Amy Eaton Reference: Totaljobs/3363 Job ID: 64014794</ns1:description>

You will join the Non-vertebrate Genomics team at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), located on the Wellcome Genome Campus near Cambridge in the UK, working on the WormBase project. You will work on a new modern and scalable back-end database and associated software for WormBase (www.wormbase.org) project. The system will be developed for, and applied to, the curation, organisation and dissemination of the complex interconnected data from the vast body of literature on the genetics, genomics and biology of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. However, our aim is that it should be sufficiently general to act as a unifying framework for all model organism database projects. The Software Developer (Java, Python) role involves the development of the following: - A graph-based data model for the representation of data from model organism genetics and genomics research; - Implementation of the data model using the modern NoSQL database Datomic (www.datomic.com); - Software for converting existing model organism data (initially from WormBase) into the new database; - APIs for interacting with the database programmatically; - Tools to allow curators to interact with the database from a web-browser. WormBase is an international consortium comprising groups at EMBL-EBI, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the California Institute of Technology and the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, and you will work closely with developers and curators at all four sites. The WormBase team at EMBL-EBI are part of a wider genomics group that produces Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes (www.ensembl.org, www.ensemblgenomes.org) and participates in numerous global collaborative genomics projects (e.g. VectorBase, PomBase). You will work in an environment that has a proven track-record of producing world-leading infrastructure and tools for the management of biological data. The EBI is part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and it is a world-leading bioinformatics centre providing biological data to the scientific community with expertise in data storage, analysis and representation. EMBL-EBI provides freely available data from life science experiments, performs basic research in computational biology and offers an extensive user training programme, supporting researchers in academic and industry. We are part of EMBL, Europe’s flagship laboratory for the life sciences. Qualifications and Experience required for the Software Developer (Java, Python) role: Essential - A degree-level qualification in computer science, bioinformatics or the biological sciences. - At least two years software development experience. - Extensive experience developing database applications - Proficiency in at least two programming languages (e.g. Java, Python) - Practical experience in at least one NoSQL database technology (e.g. MongoDB, Neo4j) - Excellent communication skills Desirable - Experience with RDF and the semantic web - Experience with Datomic (www.datomic.com) - Experience with functional programming languages, such as Clojure or Scala - Development of web-applications in JavaScript Benefits EMBL is an inclusive, equal opportunity employer offering attractive conditions and benefits appropriate to an international research organisation. The remuneration package comprises a competitive salary, a comprehensive pension and health insurance, educational and other family related benefits where applicable, as well as financial support for relocation and installation. We provide a dynamic, international working environment and have close ties with the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. EMBL-EBI staff also enjoy excellent sports facilities, a free shuttle bus to Cambridge and other nearby centres, an active sports and social club and an attractive working environment set in 55 acres of parkland.
