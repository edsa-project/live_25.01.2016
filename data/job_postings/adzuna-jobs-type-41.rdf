<ns1:description>Oracle PL/SQL Developer, TOAD, Visual Studio / VB, London, NHS, 4 months contract, ?250 - ?300 per day, Dec / Jan start date. A programmer with experience of VB and Oracle PL/SQL with Toad is needed to support an existing project in the collection of data from clients and collating it onto an Oracle database. The project has been running for more than 10 years and the programs, procedures and database architecture already exist.
