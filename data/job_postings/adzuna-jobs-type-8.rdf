<ns1:description>Data Manager / Information Architect - Governance &amp; Strategy There is now an exciting opportunity for an Information Architect / Data Manager to join this outstanding company. This is a senior role within the organisation with opportunity for progression. The current thinking is that you will become part of the Senior Management Team and report directly into the CIO.

You will manage the global master data quality through policies and processes and the direct management of the Data Management Team. What we’re looking for and why? The current IT landscape is full of opportunity because albeit the company are happy with the way their SAP System, CRM System and Web Content systems work, they are not interconnected.

There has been board approval to bring this together now under the leadership and guidance of the new Information Architect/Data Manager. You will be tasked at looking at old systems that are ready for retirement, the management and maintenance of the ‘current’ systems as well as defining, setting and standardising the global enterprise policy and strategy for all future data systems and processes. To this end, we are searching for someone who understands data and how to connect the dots between the IT systems, in particular SAP, CRM and Web Services. The need to create an effective and coherent environment that provides world class digital marketing support is a top priority.

The Web team are already delivering innovative solutions through the Microsoft SiteCore .Net platform. This really is an outstanding role with a great team who are continually pushing the business forward through technology enablement projects. Interoperability is key and we would like to speak to individuals that understand Data, Data Modelling, Policies and Processes above any particular technology stack. ‘YES’ excellent knowledge of SAP would be ideal as would Strong CRM exposure in products such as SAP, MS Dynamics or but we have SAP experts so this is not the key skill. If you have proven experience in ‘joining the dots’ and making disparate systems work together then we’d like to hear from you. What we are offering: Salary is up to ?65K Basic + Company related Bonus Scheme (up to 30%) + Outstanding Pension Scheme, Private Medical, Share option scheme, Free Parking, Free Lunches. If you have the skills, knowledge and experience then contact Scott Sherriden and Red Shrine (Leeds) to discuss this role in more detail.

<ns1:description>We&apos;re recruiting on behalf of one of the UK&apos;s best loved consumer brands for a Head of Customer Analytics. Your remit will be to lead a talented team of modellers and statistical insight professionals, driving the strategy and agenda for how this function services the thirst for actionable insight within the business. They&apos;re looking for a heavy hitter, someone with gravitas and impact which will be demonstrated through your CV where you talk about driving commercial results and demonstrable change within a business, not just technically about modelling and analysis techniques. That said you&apos;ve got to know and understand the subject matter so you&apos;re able to demonstrate to the function what good looks like too. So coming from a practitioner pedigree in your earlier career would be useful but not essential. Your team will be made up of onsite and offshore resource covering three core areas: - Customer acquisition - driving improved acquisition insight for prospecting and supporting the growth of the business - Existing customer management - leading a team of modellers and analysts who look at the existing customer base, looking to reduce churn, downgrading, cross and up sell initiatives - Viewing data insight - looking at content decisioning, advertising insight and customer management across their TV platform Your team will be up to 20 reports, with the bulk of support being local and a smaller offshore contingent. Your engagement will be with the business&apos; executive team and very senior leaders across the marketing and commercial divisions. You will be the right-hand person to the divisional director for this business area too. THE BUSINESS As mentioned earlier, they&apos;re one of the UK&apos;s best loved consumer brands. But what&apos;s remarkable about this business is its engagement level with employees. They&apos;ve developed a highly collaborative culture which cares and invests in its people and it&apos;s genuinely felt by them too. As a recruiter, I&apos;ve rarely come across such positive sentiment which is shared and remarked upon by employees from so many different divisions of this company. They all remark positively on things like empowerment, a true entrepreneurial spirit across the business and real pride in the brand. Where opportunities to join high performance career acceleration programmes exist as well as really meaty projects to get your teeth into. It&apos;s also a business with more than 10,000 employees and in excess of 5 million customers, and offers multiple products and services across the TMT space. So if you&apos;ve got the pedigree and appetite to tackle a challenge like this and want to know more, please contact Colin Doree at Blue Pelican today! Role: Head of Consumer Analysis &amp; Modelling Location: London (West) - close to main line station and underground Salary: ?90,000 - ?100,000 Benefits: ?7k car allowance, 25% on target bonus (50% maximum), pension, healthcare, life assurance and lots more KEY EXPERIENCE REQUIRED - Heavy hitting experience in driving commercial results through leading a modelling/statistical insight function on behalf of a data rich consumer business - Have experience leading teams of at least 10 experienced analysts - Your CV talks about commercial impact, driving change and improving business results by leading an analytical team - You get modelling, what good looks like and how to set the vision, strategy and agenda for a division like this - Adept with engagement senior business leaders, bringing them along for the journey, able to explain complex ideas and strategies to non-technical audiences and establish their buy-in - Great understanding of things like the Big Data eco-system and statistical best practice, the tools and the latest analytical industry techniques and how to best leverage them for commercial gain in business - Preference to having a statistical/numerical pedigree from education and have developed through the ranks within analytical business spaces. But in your career now you&apos;re seen as a leader rather than anything hands-on. - Commercially savvy, able to connect the dots between the technical and commercial aspects a role like this demands - Got to have UK based experience and also the right to live and work in the UK.

<ns1:description>Bi/ Data warehouse Developer (FULL MSBI STACK) Team Lead, greenfield project It&apos;s always an exciting opportunity to work in a cutting-edge and technically forward organisation, but even more than that to make your mark on developing their systems from scratch, setting up an entire new Data Warehouse/ Business Intelligence function and making your mark on growing up a Business Intelligence function from the ground up. It also takes a specific type of person, who has the technical abilities and talent of course but someone who lives and breathes data and BI, understanding what an organisation needs to implement in order to achieve the highest standards and meet the ambitious organisational goals. Naturally, this team are looking for an equally ambitious and driven Business Intelligence (BI)/ Data Warehouse Developer who can lead the team in achieving this! So a little about the company, they are covering huge amounts of data within the Healthcare and Financial industry making possibly one of the biggest impacts on the U.K. Whilst being completely hands on, you will be the most Senior on the team reporting into the &quot; BI Solutions Manager&quot;. You will act as a Subject matter except in delivering the BI solutions and platforms (SSIS, SSRS, SSAS). As it stands, they have a DWH in place, which they will be integrating all the data over into the new Data Warehouse and building up the new Business Intelligence functions. You will be working with a large team of roughly 50 people that cover MIS (DBA&apos;s, Data/ BI Analysts, Data Architects, Operations, Development team, APP Dev and support, PM&apos;s/ BA&apos;s and testing.) broken up into 4 team covering Data and Analytics. Although you will be immediately working with 10 people in your immediate team you will work across the board in a collaborative nature. Therefore, experience working in a team environment is essentially understanding and being apart of an entire end to end process in a software development Life-cycle. In terms of reporting, arguably one of the most importunate functions for this organisation in which they are using SSRS on the back end, and Tableau as a neat visualisation tool to represent the complex analysis of large data sets. In terms of Tableau, we realise that this is rather similar to various visualisation reporting tools such as Qlikview. We are looking for someone who has worked with reporting tools such as Tableau, Qlikview etc. who can also translate reporting conclusion to non technical users. So, to some this all up… We are looking for a Data Warehouse/ BI Developer Team Lead who will have: Extensive experience using SQL Server (2008 R2 and 2014) and strong T-SQL Previous experience Designing/ Developing a Data Warehouse from scratch (enterprise DWH is a bonus!) Experience Developing the ETL process for large data sets, developing the SSIS packages Experience developing reporting functions from scratch - SSRS Experience with visualisation reporting tools (Tableau is preferred) / Qlikview etc. Experience building SSAS OLAP cubes Working within a team environment of 5 people + (if you were a Team Lead/ Mentor that is a massive plus!) Knowledge of application lifecycle management Acting as a subject matter for BI ability to translate complex technical requirements to technical/ non technical Excellent stakeholder management experience - ability to influence important business decisions and communicate with all avenues of the business Working in an AGILE environment (and IDEALLY Waterfall too) understanding the advantages of each and able to compare/ transfer knowledge of both methodologies (SCRUM/XP/Kanban) Knowledge/ experience of Test group development and testing lifecycle Experience in managing releases and builds using version control system (TFS), in a DEV/UAT/Production environment What we will be very impressed with (ALTHOUGH NOT ESSENTIAL) Experience developing enterprise Data Warehouses MDX Experience with BIML Experience with Big Data Application development experience (.Net, C#, MVC etc) Microsoft APS (analytics Platform System) Please contact me if you think you could be a good fit, I would LOVE to tell you more about this company and the projects that they are doing send your CV to () No terminology in this advert is designed to discriminate on grounds of gender, race, colour, religion, creed, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation.

<ns1:description>7digital aims to simplify access to the world’s music and radio. Our robust, scalable digital music platform and flexible APIs are used to power comprehensive music and radio services for leading consumer brands, mobile carriers, broadcasters, automotive systems, retailers, record labels, artists and agencies. Alongside proven technology, we offer global music rights, award-winning radio production services, and content management expertise, making us a leading global partner in this space. Right now we are engaged in a number of very exciting wearable projects for will.i.am (we&apos;re the music on his Puls watch), hi-res audio services for Onkyo and Meridian, along with developing streaming products for ROK Mobile and Guvera. About this job: We need an experienced Web Operations / Systems Engineer with a high level knowledge in servers, Cisco networking, operating systems and ideally operating services in the cloud who is keen to work on a high availability and high demand system – in a collaborative manner – building a robust, resilient and automated platform which can cope with scaling up to meet an ever increasing demand: Our infrastructure is handling around 500 requests per second (and growing). Half the organisation is made up of tech people (Systems, Developers, DBAs, QAs), and the other half is actually a pretty friendly bunch and nice to work with! We’re massive fans of the DevOps movement, we organise regular events in the office and aim to keep the right focus in a fast moving industry with a very agile development team. We&apos;re running ~70% Linux but also have some Windows (for the moment anyway) – we’re pretty technology agnostic. The work opportunities are broad: We manage most of our own hardware and network and we have a lot of it (500-ish units). We run our own virtualised environments. We&apos;ve been going automation crazy (with tests and everything). It&apos;s making us happier and more productive. We’re making greater use of IaaS &amp; PaaS such as Amazon AWS.  We are currently moving our data centre to cloud over the next 6 months to move to cloud data services using AWS containerised in Docker on Linux. We have many sophisticated products and applications and are making better use of technologies like Nginx, HAProxy and Varnish within them (rather than coding our way out of every challenge). Day-to-day, this job will involve Working in a highly collaborative manner with everyone in the organisation, particularly our other technical staff. Improving the way we collaborate and get things done. Making occasional visits to our data centres to do things we can’t do remotely. About you (take your pick, the more the better): You have a proven track record in a Systems Administration/Server Engineer role. You&apos;ve worked in a product driven environment. You are aware of DevOps, what it means and want to work in an environment where the collaboration and team interactions make this happen. You know the importance of monitoring and have experience configuring and managing monitoring tools. You have hands on experience with server build automation. You&apos;re experienced with configuring network devices and routing. You&apos;ve experience with handling a lot of storage (think Petabytes) You love Linux, but you don’t think Windows inherently is evil. You have experience with database/search infrastructure. You’re experienced with maintaining high availability and high demand systems. You care about you being better, your team being better and your company being better. You enjoy working with other people outside of IT operations. Technologies: You don’t need to know them all, but if you have experience with many of these, things are looking promising. OS: Debian Linux, Windows Server 2008R2/2012 Web servers, proxies and Caches: Nginx, IIS, Varnish, HAProxy Automation: We use Chef &amp; some CFEngine (+ other things). Hardware: Dell, Cisco, Juniper Cloud computing: Amazon AWS, Azure Monitoring: Zabbix, New Relic, Logstash, Kibana, Graphite, StatsD Source Control: Git, Subversion CI/CD: Jenkins, TeamCity Database/document stores: SQL Server, Mongodb, elasticsearch, Solr Storage: GlusterFS Other important tech: Debian Package Management, KVM, ASP.NET, PowerDNS, RackTables Other tech you might run into, but not daily: Apache, Exim, SFTP, ProFTPd, MySQL, Samba To apply for this positon please submit your CV online.</ns1:description>
