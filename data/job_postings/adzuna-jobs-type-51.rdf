<ns1:description>Our client a specialist environmental consultancy, have an opportunity for an experienced environmental scientist to come and join their existing team. The role has come about due to an increase in work load and a fantastic opportunity to join an established team. The key requirement of the role is for you to be an experienced environmental scientist ideally with project management experience from either a contaminated land or remediation back ground. The role will involve project delivery from the initial stages to completion, in addition to report writing and tendering responsibilities. The project base is varied, with current work including but not exclusively residential development and hydrocarbon cleanup. Your commercial experience ideally within a consultancy, needs to be coupled with a good academic background. You will have a degree in a relevant subject i.e Environmental science or geology or similar. All this will be coupled with a can do attitude and the ambition to expand your technical knowledge as you progress within the organisation. As an organisation they have multiple offices across the UK, Ireland and Europe, with an ever growing project portfolio and reputation within the market. The Midlands base is one of their flagship offices and genuinely finds the balance between excellent project delivery and work life balance of staff. This is a fantastic opportunity to join a company that is still small enough for you to feel valued and big enough to give you a strong project portfolio for you to progress your technical skills and personal development.

<ns1:description>The Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) is an international centre for scientific research situated in Grenoble, France. We are Europe&apos;s leading neutron science facility. We receive over 2000 visiting scientists per year to carry out world-class research in a wide variety of scientific fields.The ILL upgrade programme and the European SINE2020 project have a common goal to foster a collective, Europe-wide approach to data reduction and analysis that will transform data treatment for neutron scattering experiments for the decade to come. The Computing for Science (CS) Group in the ILL’s Science Division is therefore currently recruiting: Three Scientific Software Programmers (M/F) Duties: The mission of the CS Group is to deliver and support the critical data treatment software that enables visiting scientists to exploit their scattering data effectively during experiments.In this context, your duties will focus primarily on data reduction for a range of instruments in the Mantid code [www.mantidproject.org]. The work includes: writing loaders for ILL data which is in the NeXus/HDF5 format, implementing data reduction workflows based as far as possible on existing algorithms in the Mantid code, adding new algorithms, where necessary, validating results against existing software and implementing graphical user interfaces, interacting with scientists and software developers to ensure that software is delivered in a timely and effective manner. Qualifications and experience: You have - at least - a Master’s degree in a physical science or software engineering. You are: a software developer interested in working in a leading scientific facility or a scientist with a strong track-record in software development, expert in Python and C++ programming and familiar with the modern software development methods and environment (e.g. Eclipse, GitHub…), service-oriented and a committed team player in order to work effectively with members of the CS group, scientists and European partners. Language skills: As an international research centre, we are particularly keen to attract applicants from outside France. You must have a sound knowledge of English and be willing to learn French (a language course will be paid for by the ILL). Knowledge of German would be an advantage. Notes: 36-month fixed-term contracts For further information, contact Mark Johnson, Head of Computing for Science and coordinator of the SINE2020 project. Benefits: Generous company benefits (expatriation allowance), relocation assistance and language courses may be offered for you and your spouse (for more information, please consult our employment conditions). How to apply: Please submit your application on-line, no later than 03/01/2016, via our web site: (vacancy reference: 15/22).The interviews will take place on week 4 of 2016.

Utilising broad &amp; flexible skills to a range of diverse machining processes. Working closely with team members in a design engineer &amp; scientist community to work on early stage prototypes &amp; bespoke scientific instruments. A collaborative &amp; proactive working style &amp; attitude are essential. Candidate Requirements: CNC Milling experience essential. Adept at CNC programming with Fanuc &amp; Heidenhain controls preferable. Confident on CAM systems such as Delcam with CAD knowledge such as Solidworks an advantage. Time-served Apprenticeship will relevant engineering qualifications. The relevant candidate must have good manual dexterity and also be flexible and able to cope with a varied work-load as they may be switching projects or working on more than one project at a time. There is no particular product they would work on as this is at the prototype side but when they are working on a prototype it would be from start to finish. All products will be small enough to fit into the palm of your hand. There is an element here of working closely with scientists and R&amp;D who come up with ideas so soft skills are important. The ideal candidate will have varied experience so they can work on different aspects of the build process and CNC Milling experience is essential. A traditional working apprenticeship is highly desirable because it means the candidate will have had great, hands on experience from the start of their career.
