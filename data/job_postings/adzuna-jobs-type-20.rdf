<ns1:description>BASIC FUNCTION: Preparation of order of magnitude and detailed estimates for budgeting and competitive tender estimates to the accuracy specified for Austin prospects and projects, within the required time period. Prepare Change Authorisation estimates as required by the project. Assist in the procurement activities for the project as requested. Prepare monthly project cost condition/statistics statements. Assist in finalising sub-contractors accounts. Develop, refine and keep benchmarking information on all completed projects. Assist and support, when required, with sales activities. NATURE AND SCOPE: The major portion of this department&apos;s work, however, is in the preparation of detailed cost estimates using design drawings and outline specifications produced during Preliminary Engineering, referred to as Step 1B in Austin’s parlance. This estimate will be required to have an accuracy of +/- 10% or better. During the development of the preliminary architectural and engineering design, the incumbent will often be consulted (by the Facilities Development Director) regarding various options and costs of building materials and systems being considered. The incumbent must analyse the costs associated with the various options and give the pros and cons on each item so that a rational decision can be made on the direction to proceed. This will necessitate reviewing scope with the design team and obtaining check prices from the market place. Following completion of the preliminary conceptual design drawings, the outline specifications are prepared with the guidance and assistance of the incumbent. The combination of drawings and specifications comprise the Scope of Work from which the detailed estimate is generated. The incumbent must plan the required format of the estimate with agreed arrangement of cost sorting which will be required for procurement and reporting purposes. M&amp;E estimates are generally provided by Engineering but the estimator will be required to seek costs from contractors for proper incorporation into the final estimate and challenging the estimates to ensure all items are included and competitive. The Estimator is required to obtain market prices wherever possible for each estimate. This will require discussions with sub-contractors and others to ensure the information is available in a timely manner. This position requires a review of the estimate with the Construction Manager in order to prepare a realistic construction schedule and site organisation. He/she shall also review the cost estimate with the Commercial Director and the Managing Director. The cost estimate shall only be issued once it has been checked and approved and signed off by the checker and the Managing Director. The need to meet presentation deadlines and provide adequate review time by superiors, places a scheduling burden on this position which the incumbent controls through the daily monitoring of progress and information availability. Backlogs are to be controlled through and with the agreement of the Commercial Director by scheduling overtime and using additional personnel on a temporary basis. This position operates within established Company policies, Engineering Advice Letters and the direction of the Commercial Director. The estimator shall be aware of engineering and construction techniques and practices, building codes and regulatory restrictions and other estimating principles. The incumbent is given latitude in the preparation of estimates with the provision that the estimates are accurate and the fee structure has been established by the Managing Director. Once a project is released for implementation into the engineering and construction phase, the incumbent distributes the estimate and other pertinent data through the Project Manager to the Engineering, Commercial, Construction and Accounting Departments for their use as a control document. Preparations of Change Authorisations quickly as requested by ECA. Estimator must search all information and keep a log of all Change Order’s. As required provide information to prepare Job Condition Statement’s and prepare the Job Condition Statement (External Cost Report). The incumbent maintains historical records on all past projects for use as the basis for future estimates of a similar scope. Undertake the purchasing activities including requesting subcontract tenders; determining tender contract conditions; tender analysis; making recommendations; placing contracts; issuing &quot;Head Office Instructions&quot;; agreeing final account. Assist in the preparation of a QA approval database of sub-contractors. QUALIFICATIONS: The desired prerequisites for this position include a four to five year degree in architecture or engineering or Quantity Surveying; a minimum of ten years of experience in the building industry, three or four of which should be in estimating or quantity surveying.</ns1:description>

The day to day activities will include a) managing the supplier data in conjunctino with the programmer and data specialist to ensure that the data is editied to a format that is acceptable for their product database b) providing date from the database that suits the requirements of the website, eprocurement platforms, tenders and other product listings c) sytematically meeting wtih existing and potential eprocurement platform providers to increase their depth and coverage of the clients products d) formulate and manage the data budget requirements annually e) monitor existing eprocurement platforms sales and review their effectiveness f) providing quarterly reports to the board on eprocurement and data g) managing other members of the data team to enable ta streamlined process h) managing the product database to ensre the data quality is optimised to provide the best outputs i) implementing best practice data procedures to ensure data integrity j) troubleshoot data errors k) ensure data for the website will provide customers with all that is requried for them to make an informed dcision with regards to purchase.
