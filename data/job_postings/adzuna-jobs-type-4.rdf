<ns1:description>Say hello to big brands &amp; bigger career opportunities. TJX Europe is a growth vehicle for the TJX Companies, Inc. - the world’s leading off-price fashion and home ware retailer with sales of nearly $29.1 billion*, more than 3,300 stores in six countries and approximately 198,000 Associates (TJX Europe includes TK Maxx in UK&amp;Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria and HomeSense). With extensive career options, TJX Europe is one of the most successful and exciting retailers thanks to our business model of no-frills stores with opportunistic buying. So our savvy shoppers get top fashion &amp; home ware brands for up to 60% less. TJX has launched eCommerce in the UK only under the tkmaxx.com banner. As we continue to grow we will launch eCommerce across Europe under TK Maxx and, potentially, HomeSense banners. We are collecting an increasing amount of information about our marketing campaigns, purchasing behaviours and our customers’ preferences, both through new channels to the business such as eCommerce, mobile, social, and loyalty schemes as well as through third parties (e.g. agencies) and more traditional routes, including our store networks and customer service centres. We need to ensure we have the systems, processes and analyses in place, to take full advantage of this information, throughout our Brand &amp; Marketing activities and eCommerce to inform decisions across the rest of our business. We also need to ensure we have a roadmap to grow these toward a pan-European, omni-channel strategy for customer data. The Head of Customer Analytics &amp; Strategy is therefore a pivotal and important role in the organisation that reports into the VP - Marketing Director, Europe. The role will blend excellence in providing data analysis, to drive value in the business, with the ability to lead and set the vision for customer analytics across Europe and deliver the systems, processes, and team required to realise this vision. Desired Skills and Experience We’re a passionate bunch here at TJX Europe. We’re passionate about retail and the latest trends in fashion. Above everything, we’re looking for someone who shares this interest in the industry and who can add a different dimension to our culture. To be successful in this role you will be experienced in analysing and managing large scale customer data. You will have a fascination around customers and data and understand the multi-channel shopping environment. You will have a good understanding of systems and technologies relating to customer data, specification and selection of systems. We’re also looking for a great leader with effective negotiation, influencing and communication skills across all levels. We are proud that we can offer progressive career possibilities, competitive salaries and exciting opportunities. We are committed to support your goals so you can help us achieve ours. If you would like to be a part of something very unique then please apply today. * Fiscal year ending February 2, 2015</ns1:description>

<ns1:description>Graduate Online Analyst - Extensive training - London If you are an analytical graduate with some coding skills, I have a trainee website analysis role with an amazing agency.. fantastic training.. Perhaps you find the online world very exciting but don’t know how to engage with it, perhaps you have played with Google Analytics.. I think my client would be interested in meeting you.. My client is one of the UK&apos;s leading website analytics companies.. And they like to find Economics or Maths graduates with an interest or passion for the web. Ideally they like to see candidates with some coding experience such as HTML or Javascript.. This is not essential but would be a massive advantage My client is a very geeky analytics consultancy that have grown through developing their own talent. Initially they tried to find candidates with a &quot;ready made skills set&quot; of web analytics, javascript, html, web analysis tools such as coremetrics, Google Analytics, but they quickly realised that these people are far too expensive and that &quot;old dogs and new tricks&quot; don’t mix.. They quickly found fresh ideas and new imaginative ideas come from new fresh imaginative minds.. So they want to find Maths and Economics grads who DON’T want to be accountants or FX traders.. On a daily basis, you&apos;ll be working with client Websites analysing user journey&apos;s, measuring bounce rates, defining Google Analytics goals to measure events, measuring traffic flows, measuring individual user journeys against site destinations.. Do you get the picture? Are excited by the description.. If you do, please make contact with me, Trevor Jones Goodchildsmith Digital Recruitment</ns1:description>
