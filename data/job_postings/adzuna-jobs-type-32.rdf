<ns1:description>Our client is a respected developer of security technology implemented within mobile phone platforms. Their products are now used in a significant portion of the consumer market as more and more hardware providers adopt the innovative new technology. As they grow, the company seeks an experienced test developer, confident creating robust test frameworks, harnesses and automation tools for verification of the company’s technology. Candidates must have commercial experience in a number of key areas: • Java EE development, demonstrating a strong knowledge of OO principles and perhaps UML; • test framework technologies, particularly JUnit and Arquillian; • continuous integration and build tools such as Jenkins, Nexus or Sonar; • web service technologies (SOAP or REST), and knowledge of XML; and • RDBMS languages, ideally Oracle or a SQL flavour. The company has offices across Europe, and development is spread out between different teams. The role is based in central Cambridge, though candidates should expect some infrequent travel between development sites. The Cambridge offices offer a modern and bright environment, with plenty of mod cons. The location has great transport links to Cambridgeshire and London, and on offer is a first-rate salary and benefits package. Interested in hearing more, submit your CV to us now!

<ns1:description>About the Role  The role presents an excellent opportunity for candidates to hold a senior position an agile team of highly skilled developers working to advance our feature-rich products using the latest technologies and methodologies. We have a range of systems including our desktop site, mobile site, mobile app, administration system, customer portal and embedded systems - used in third party websites (desktop and mobile). We are constantly developing all of these systems and more to add new features, handle increasing scale, improve usability and support new platforms. You will be working closely with the Technical Director, Creative Director and UX experts to enhance and enrich a focused subset of our product portfolio. This is a development – not design – centric role, however you should have a keen eye for design detail and appreciation of good UI/UX as you will be working with UX designers to create brilliant interfaces and experiences. Day to Day Responsibilities Inspire and motivate a multi-discipline software development team Be a point of contact for the development aspect of projects Work with the SDM to oversee day to day workload and delegation of tasks Manage the lifecycle of tasks including gathering requirements and writing technical specifications Help build a ‘delivery with high quality’ culture that is accountability and results orientated Meet ambitious timelines while balancing business risks and trade-offs Drive the team to continuously improve processes and skills Delivery Understand intimately the dependencies between components and how they combine to deliver service to the end consumer and to the business Execute and plan changes as appropriate to meet changing needs and requirements Provide technical direction for design, development, testing and deployment from definition phase through planning, implementation and maintenance Easily recognize system deficiencies and implement effective solutions Continuous improvement of processes through automation of common procedures, and implementation of standards, processes and checklists Work with the SDM to measure and review the Productivity, Quality and Duration of delivery, taking prompt corrective action where necessary What we need from you  Expert in HTML5, CSS3 and building Javascript applications Expert in performance and optimisation Comprehensive understanding of browser rendering engines and how to debug performance failings Familiarity with CSS preprocessors and associated build chain tooling Familiarity with a11y and accessibility in general Broad understanding of HTTP and the web in general Thorough understanding of and practical experience with SOLID principles Thorough understanding of DDD and true Object Orientation. Passionate about your work and continuously seek to improve standards Happy working in a fast paced and quickly evolving team Embrace and promote necessary change Experience of mentoring and leading a team Strong analytical and diagnostic skills, particularly with regard to technical risks, issues and constraints Proven track record of leading teams on complex software projects Able to motivate and mentor others Demonstrate senior principles, leading by example in terms of work ethic and professional attitude Able to manage work and prioritise effectively Excellent written and verbal communication skills Team player, who strives to maximise team and departmental performance  About UNiDAYS  Focused  We aren’t an agency with external clients imposing impossible time/budget deadlines, our code IS our business and so ensuring a consistently high level of quality is paramount. Our guiding principles are:  Zero technical debt Quality Scalability and Performance Challenging Ourselves and Continuous Improvement If a job is going to take twice as long as its estimate to complete in order to achieve the level of quality we desire, then so be it (although we’ll expect an explanation). Agile Pragmatism Everyone is equal and encouraged to work with each other as best suited to solve problems. If you’ve got an idea or a request then there’s no red tape. If you can demonstrate its worth then it’s likely to happen - be it the use of a new technology, a piece of equipment or a change to our entire development approach. We try our best to apply Occam’s Razor to everything we do. Our product owners and stakeholders truly understand the value of iterative development and embrace the process of continual improvement. We continually strive to reduce waste by keeping paperwork and meetings to a minimum. The development team is physically centered around a giant Kanban board which we use to track the progress of high level priorities and individual tasks. This goes most of the way to eliminating problems with communication before they even occur. We try to test-drive all development, we have a sophisticated test environment that allows us to run our platforms entirely in memory - allowing us to perform truly end-to-end tests of our web pipeline. We try to thoroughly test all business logic, but also try hard not to go overboard and test the blatantly obvious, keeping refactoring simple and easy. Keep Your Tools Sharp We’ll buy you any licenses you need to be productive. We’ll send you to any interesting conferences you can find, as well as support you if you want to be a speaker. We regularly attend, sponsor and speak at our local meetups and believe in supporting and giving back to the community. We’ve run free training workshops in the past and are looking into Code Club sponsorship. A Team That Plays Together A team that plays together stays together. We use Slack for internal comms (i.e. GIFs), we use Git properly, have a formidable Unreal Tournament team, bake cakes on Thursdays, compete at table football, and are useless at ping pong and snooker despite having the facilities. Feel free to own someone from another department! You will also find us enjoying each others’ company outside of the office. Come Join Us  You’ll love it as much as we do.  Contact: Sabrina Munns Reference: Totaljobs Job ID: 64114569</ns1:description>

Our client is an established, but growing full service agency with an impressive customer base and an even more impressive track record. Due to continued growth plans, they have an exciting new opportunity for a Junior Front End Developer to join their team. Whether you’re a recent graduate who has had some experience of web development, or whether you’re looking for a new position in an energetic tea, this could be the role for you. You must have had exposure to HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery, and using Adobe Creative Suite will come as second nature. Ideally, you’ll have used WordPress, and candidates with a design background will have an advantage. If SASS, LESS, Bootstrap and Zurb mean nothing to you, then this isn’t the role for you! However, if finding new solutions and creating amazing pieces of work for a range of clients is what makes you tick, apply now. Based in Leeds and working from an impressive head office environment, in one of Leeds’ trendiest areas, you’d be joining a supportive team of developers, designers and account managers, who pride themselves in delivering the best digital solutions for their clients. In return for your hard work, you’ll benefit from a competitive salary, great career progression and free parking!” Contact: Jordan Fox Reference: Totaljobs/JF/10747 Job ID: 64095927</ns1:description>
