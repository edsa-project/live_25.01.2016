<ns1:description>Due to an increase in workload within the team, South West Water is looking for two Data Analysts to undertake the migration of data from one SCADA system to a new one and put together digital drawings of site information to use as reference points for the alarms team. We are looking for an enthusiastic and capable person who will help us deliver our business plan and maintain a high standard of service to our internal and external customers. You will be part of a challenging and stimulating environment providing state-of-the-art technology for business-critical applications, in a dedicated and professional project delivery team. Working on critical technology that gives us visibility and remote control of our physical assets at site locations across the region, you will help us deploy a brand new industry-leading telemetry system and provide support to the operational business groups who rely on it for maintaining the water and sewerage services to South West Water&apos;s customers. The role of the SCADA Data Analyst is to ensure the quality and integrity of data used by the in-house Telemetry and Process Control systems that support core business functions. The analyst will apply proven communication, analytical, and problem-solving skills to help resolve issues in order to maximise the benefit of systems investments. You will work on two key projects supporting the migration of information from the ageing, obsolete system being replaced, to the new cutting-edge system: Data Cleanse and Site Mimic Build. Data Cleanse involves the extraction of data, its subsequent validation and replacement where necessary with improved data, using macro-enabled spreadsheets. Site Mimic Build involves the use of the new system SCOPE-X to develop simple graphical representations of assets and their processes at site locations across the SWW region. The role involves working to set instructions and then interrogating the data in order to resolve issues and update ready for transfer to the new system. The ideal candidates must be happy working with large spreadsheets on a daily basis and have a strong analytical capability and experience in problem solving. You must also possess good communication skills, be organised and have the ability to stay calm under pressure.
